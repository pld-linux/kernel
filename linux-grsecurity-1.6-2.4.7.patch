    on the use of this driver. 
 
+Non-executable Stack
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_STACK
+  If you say Y here, your system will not allow execution of
+  code on the stack, making buffer overflow exploitation more difficult.
+  Exploits will have to dabble in more obscure methods of
+  exploitation(bss,got,heap..)
+
+Gcc trampoline support
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_STACK_GCC
+  If you say Y here, the system will support trampoline code along
+  with the stack protection.  If you do not have any programs on
+  your system that require this (glibc 2.0 users must say YES to
+  this option) you may say no here.
+
+PaX protection
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_PAX
+  PaX (http://pax.low-level.net) enforces no execution on the stack
+  as well as all memory pages.  This not only stops buffer overflows
+  that execute code on the stack, but also many other methods of
+  exploitation including bss and the heap.  This greatly reduces the
+  window attackers have to compromise a system, and raises the difficulty 
+  of ways to do so.  It has a few drawbacks however, as compared to
+  the Openwall patch.  It incurs a greater performance hit; reportedly
+  5-8% for certain intensive operations, and a negligable amount for normal
+  operations.  It has problems with XFree86 4.x though, making it
+  kill random things in X and slowing it down to a crawl.  If you don't use
+  XFree86 4.x, it's highly recommended you say Y here instead of choosing
+  the Openwall patch.
+
+Proc Restrictions
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_PROC
+  If you say Y here, the permissions of the /proc filesystem
+  will be altered to enhance system security and privacy.  Depending
+  upon the options you choose, you can either restrict users to see
+  only the processes they themselves run, or choose a group that can
+  not see all processes, but can view other proc entries that would
+  normally be restricted to the user.  If you're running identd as
+  a non-root user, you will have to run it as the group you specify here.
+  
+Linking restrictions
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_LINK
+  If you say Y here, /tmp race exploits will be prevented, since users
+  will no longer be able to follow symlinks owned by other users in 
+  world-writeable +t directories (i.e. /tmp), unless the owner of the 
+  symlink is the owner of the directory. users will also not be
+  able to hardlink to files they do not own.
+
+FIFO restrictions
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_FIFO
+  If you say Y here, users will not be able to write to FIFOs they don't
+  own in world-writeable +t directories (i.e. /tmp), unless the owner of
+  the FIFO is the same owner of the directory it's held in.
+
+Secure file descriptors
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_FD
+  If you say Y here, set*id binaries will be protected from data spoofing
+  attacks (eg. making a program read /etc/shadow).  The patches do this
+  by opening up /dev/null to any of the stdin, stdout, stderr file descriptors
+  for set*id binaries that are open and run by a user that is not the owner
+  of the file.
+
+Exec process limiting
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_EXECVE
+  If you say Y here, users with a resource limit on processes will
+  have the value checked during execve() calls.  The current system
+  only checks the system limit during fork() calls.
+
+Exec logging
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_EXECLOG
+  If you say Y here, all execve() calls will be logged (since the
+  other exec*() calls are frontends to execve(), all execution
+  will be logged).  Useful for shell-servers that like to keep track
+  of their users.
+  WARNING: This option when enabled will produce a LOT of logs, especially
+  on an active system.
+ 
+Set*id logging
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_SUID
+  If you say Y here, all set*id() calls will be logged.  Such information
+  could be useful when detecting a possible intrusion attempt.
+
+Signal logging
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_SIGNAL
+  If you say Y here, certain important signals will be logged, such as
+  SIGSEGV, which will as a result inform you of when a error in a program
+  occured, which in some cases could mean a possible exploit attempt.
+
+BSD-style coredumps
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_COREDUMP
+  If you say Y here, linux will use a style similar to BSD for
+  coredumps, core.processname.  Not a security feature, just
+  a useful one.
+
+Fork failure logging
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_FORKFAIL
+  If you say Y here, all failed fork() attempts will be logged.
+  This could suggest a fork bomb, or someone attempting to overstep
+  their process limit.
+
+Time change logging
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_TIME
+  If you say Y here, any changes of the system clock will be logged.
+
+Secure keymap loading
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_KBMAP
+  If you say Y here, KDSKBENT and KDSKBSENT ioctl calls being
+  called by unprivileged users will be denied. If you answer N,
+  everyone will be able to modify keyboard bindings.
+
+  Saying N makes hacking root account easier for anyone who
+  has access to the console.                     
+
+Enhanced network randomness
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_RANDNET
+  If you say Y here, the functions controlling the randomness
+  of the Linux IP stack will be enhanced to decrease the chances
+  of being able to predict certain packets that require some
+  amount of randomness.
+
+Chroot jail restrictions
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_CHROOT
+  If you say Y here, processes in a chrooted jail will be much more
+  difficult to break out of.  It stops most generic ways of breaking
+  a chroot jail. Adding in chroot jail restrictions adds these
+  protective measures to the kernel:
+  No mknod()
+  No ptracing
+  No fchmod +s or chmod +s (usually used to create a rootshell)
+  No double chroots
+  Restricted signal sending to other processes
+  No mounting or remounting of devices
+  Enforced chdir("/") on all chroots
+
+Log all execs within a jail
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_CHROOT_EXECLOG
+  If you say Y here, all executions inside a chroot jail will be logged to
+  syslog.
+
+Chroot jail capability restrictions
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_CHROOT_CAPS
+  If you say Y here, the capabilities on all root processes within a
+  chroot jail will be lowered to stop module insertion, raw i/o,
+  system and net admin tasks, transferring capabilities, and
+  tty configuration tasks.  This is left an option because it breaks
+  some apps (glftpd)  Disable this if your chrooted apps are having
+  problems.
+
+Trusted path execution
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_TPE
+  If you say Y here, you will be able to choose a gid to add to the
+  supplementary groups of users you want to mark as "untrusted."
+  These users will not be able to execute any files that are not in
+  root-owned directories writeable only by root. 
+
+Partially restrict non-root users
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_TPE_ALL
+  If you say Y here, All other non-root users will only be allowed to
+  execute files in directories they own that are not group or
+  world-writeable, or in directories owned by root and writeable only by
+  root.
+
+Trusted path execution glibc protection
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_TPE_GLIBC
+  If you say Y here, all non-root users will not be able to execute
+  any files while glibc specific environment variables such as
+  LD_PRELOAD are set, which could be used to evade the trusted
+  path execution protection.  It also protects against evasion
+  through /lib/ld-2.*  It is recommended you say Y here also.
+
+Randomized PIDs
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_RANDPID
+  If you say Y here, all PIDs created on the system will be
+  pseudo-randomly generated.  This is extremely effective along
+  with the /proc restrictions to disallow an attacker from guessing
+  pids of daemons, etc.  PIDs are also used in some cases as part
+  of a naming system for temporary files, so this option would keep
+  those filenames from being predicted as well.  We also use code
+  to make sure that PID numbers aren't reused too soon.
+
+Randomized IP IDs
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_RANDID
+  If you say Y here, all the id field on all outgoing packets
+  will be randomized.  This hinders os fingerprinters and
+  keeps your machine from being used as a bounce for an untraceable
+  portscan.  Ids are used for fragmented packets, fragments belonging
+  to the same packet have the same id.  By default linux only
+  increments the id value on each packet sent to an individual host.
+  I've replaced the usage of all the other ip generation routines with
+  my own for speed.  I generate random data for 64 packets at once and
+  distribute them as needed.  I also keep track of the last 32 packets
+  so that we don't create two packets with the same ids too soon,
+  which would cause problems if the packets were fragmented and had
+  to be reassembled.
+  This option will make your system more OpenBSD-ish ;)
+
+Randomized TCP source ports
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_RANDSRC
+  If you say Y here, situations where a source port is generated on the
+  fly for the TCP protocol (ie. with connect() ) will be altered so that
+  the source port is generated at random, instead of a simple incrementing
+  algorithm.
+
+Altered Ping IDs
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_RANDPING
+  If you say Y here, the way Linux handles echo replies will be changed
+  so that the reply uses an ID equal to the ID of the echo request.
+  This will help in confusing OS detection.
+
+Randomized TTL
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_RANDTTL
+  If you say Y here, your TTL (time to live) for packets will be set at
+  random, with a base level you specify, to further confuse OS detection.
+  The default base level for this option is set to the Linux default.
+
+Socket restrictions
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_SOCKET
+  If you say Y here, you will be able to choose from several options.
+  If you assign a GID on your system and add it to the supplementary
+  groups of users you want to restrict socket access to, this patch
+  will do one of three things, based on the option(s) you choose.
+  Deny all socket access: keeps users from connecting to other hosts
+  from the machine or running servers from the machine
+  Deny all client sockets: keeps users from connecting to other machines
+  only
+  Deny all server sockets: keeps users from running servers on the machine
+  You should change the GID's from the default to what you have set up on
+  your system.
+
+Stealth network enhancements
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_STEALTH
+  If you say Y here, you will enable several enhancements that will
+  improve your system's protection against portscans.
+  Enabling these options and filtering all open ports should make
+  your machine very hard to detect, while not interfering with (most)
+  normal operation.
+
+Oblivion ACL System
+CONFIG_OBV_PROC
+  If you say Y here, you enable the Access Control List system for 
+  grsecurity called Oblivion. You will need to run obvadm setup 
+  to set your password and create your config files.

+ * Oblivion: A Security-Enhancing Linux Kernel Modification
+ * Author: Michael Dalton
+ * E-Mail: shadowrye@linux.com
+ * Information: This modification is designed to give 
+ * fine-tuned control over processes, to prevent
+ * the damage of buffer overflows by disallowing them to run or
+ * write to anything that is abnormal.  It also protects files from
+ * access by unauthorized programs(read only/append only/hidden modes)
+ * and has capability management features.
+ *
+ * Modifications
+ * 4-20-2001 - Began development of OPM .3 
+ * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * */
+
+/* Access Layers */
+
+
+/* Files -
+ * file database -> file info
+ */
+
+/* Process
+ * process database -> process entry (and capabilities) -> process file access rights

+      of space required to store an array of MAX_INT is allocated on the
+      stack.  Assuming a 32-bit integer, this needs only 32 *
+      sizeof(stack_node) == 136 bits.  Pretty cheap, actually.
+
+   2. Chose the pivot element using a median-of-three decision tree.
+      This reduces the probability of selecting a bad pivot value and
+      eliminates certain extraneous comparisons.
+
+   3. Only quicksorts TOTAL_ELEMS / MAX_THRESH partitions, leaving
+      insertion sort to order the MAX_THRESH items within each partition.
+      This is a big win, since insertion sort is faster for small, mostly
+      sorted array segments.
+
+   4. The larger of the two sub-partitions is always pushed onto the
+      stack first, with the algorithm then concentrating on the
+      smaller partition.  This *guarantees* no more than log (n)
