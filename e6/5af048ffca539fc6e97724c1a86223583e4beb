- added %{subname} to kernel_release to allow simultaneous installation
  of normal and grsecurity kernel (there was conflict on
  /lib/modules/%{version}-%{release})
- release 3 to rebuild, but keep in mind that previous release was not
  integer due to adding lustre support which is still NFY/not tested)
