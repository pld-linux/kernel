+Subject: Debugging with NMI

+To: David Grothe <dave@gcom.com>
+
+Kernel hackers:
+
+Maybe this is old hat, but it is new to me --
+
+On an ISA bus machine, if you short out the A1 and B1 pins of an ISA
+slot you will generate an NMI to the CPU.  This interrupts even a
+machine that is hung in a loop with interrupts disabled.  Used in
+conjunction with kgdb <
+ftp://ftp.gcom.com/pub/linux/src/kgdb-2.3.35/kgdb-2.3.35.tgz > you can
+gain debugger control of a machine that is hung in the kernel!  Even
+without kgdb the kernel will print a stack trace so you can find out
+where it was hung.
+
+The A1/B1 pins are directly opposite one another and the farthest pins
+towards the bracket end of the ISA bus socket.  You can stick a paper
+clip or multi-meter probe between them to short them out.
+
+I had a spare ISA bus to PC104 bus adapter around.  The PC104 end of the
+board consists of two rows of wire wrap pins.  So I wired a push button
+between the A1/B1 pins and now have an ISA board that I can stick into
+any ISA bus slot for debugger entry.
+
+Microsoft has a circuit diagram of a PCI card at
+http://www.microsoft.com/hwdev/DEBUGGING/DMPSW.HTM.  If you want to
+build one you will have to mail them and ask for the PAL equations.
+Nobody makes one comercially.
+
+[THIS TIP COMES WITH NO WARRANTY WHATSOEVER.  It works for me, but if
+your machine catches fire, it is your problem, not mine.]

+Thanks to Elena Zanoni, gdb (developement version) can now calculate
+correctly addresses  of dynamically loaded object files. I have not been
+following gdb developement for sometime and am not sure when symbol
+address calculation fix is going to appear in a gdb stable version.
+
+Elena, any idea when the fix will make it to a prebuilt gdb from a
+redhat release?
+
+For the time being I have built a gdb developement version. It can be
+used for module debugging with loadmodule.sh script.
+
+The problem with calculating of module addresses with previous versions
+of gdb was as follows:
+gdb did not use base address of a section while calculating address of
+a symbol in the section in an object file loaded via 'add-symbol-file'.
+It used address of .text segment instead. Due to this addresses of
+symbols in .data, .bss etc. (e.g. global variables) were calculated incorrectly.
+
+Above mentioned fix allow gdb to use base address of a segment while
+calculating address of a symbol in it. It adds a parameter '-s' to
+'add-symbol-file' command for specifying base address of a segment.
+
+loadmodule.sh script works as follows.
+
+1. Copy a module file to target machine.
+2. Load the module on the target machine using insmod with -m parameter.
+insmod produces a module load map which contains base addresses of all
+sections in the module and addresses of symbols in the module file.
+3. Find all sections and their base addresses in the module from
+the module map.
+4. Generate a script that loads the module file. The script uses
+'add-symbol-file' and specifies address of text segment followed by
+addresses of all segments in the module.
+
+Here is an example gdb script produced by loadmodule.sh script.
+
+add-symbol-file foo 0xd082c060 -s .text.lock 0xd08cbfb5
+-s .fixup 0xd08cfbdf -s .rodata 0xd08cfde0 -s __ex_table 0xd08e3b38
+-s .data 0xd08e3d00 -s .bss 0xd08ec8c0 -s __ksymtab 0xd08ee838
+
+With this command gdb can calculate addresses of symbols in ANY segment
+in a module file.
+
+Regards.

+#
+# The basic idea is to find where insmod load the module and inform
+# GDB to load the symbol table of the module with the GDB command
+# ``add-symbol-file <object> <address>''.
+#
+# The Linux kernel holds the list of all loaded modules in module_list,
+# this list end with &kernel_module (exactly with module->next == NULL,
+# but the last module is not a real module).
+#
+# Insmod allocates the struct module before the object file.  Since
+# Linux-2.1, this structure contain his size.  The real address of
+# the object file is then (char*)module + module->size_of_struct.
+#
+# You can use three user functions ``mod-list'', ``mod-print-symbols''
+# and ``add-module-symbols''.
+#
+# mod-list list all loaded modules with the format:
+#    <module-address> <module-name>
+#
+# As soon as you have found the address of your module, you can
+# print its exported symbols (mod-print-symbols) or inform GDB to add
+# symbols from your module file (mod-add-symbols).
+#
+# The argument that you give to mod-print-symbols or mod-add-symbols
+# is the <module-address> from the mod-list command.
+#
+# When using the mod-add-symbols command you must also give the full
+# pathname of the modules object code file.
+#
+# The command mod-add-lis is an example of how to make this easier.
+# You can edit this macro to contain the path name of your own
+# favorite module and then use it as a shorthand to load it.  You
+# still need the module-address, however.
+#
+# The internal function ``mod-validate'' set the GDB variable $mod
+# as a ``struct module*'' if the kernel known the module otherwise
+# $mod is set to NULL.  This ensure to not add symbols for a wrong
+# address.

+Last edit: <20030806.1637.12>
+This file has information specific to the i386 kgdb option.  Other
+platforms with the kgdb option may behave in a similar fashion.
+
+New features:
+============
+20030806.1557.37
+This version was made against the 2.6.0-test2 kernel. We have made the
+following changes:
+
+- The getthread() code in the stub calls find_task_by_pid().  It fails
+  if we are early in the bring up such that the pid arrays have yet to
+  be allocated.  We have added a line to kernel/pid.c to make
+  "kgdb_pid_init_done" true once the arrays are allocated.  This way the
+  getthread() code knows not to call.  This is only used by the thread
+  debugging stuff and threads will not yet exist at this point in the
+  boot.
+
+- For some reason, gdb was not asking for a new thread list when the
+  "info thread" command was given.  We changed to the newer version of
+  the thread info command and gdb now seems to ask when needed.  Result,
+  we now get all threads in the thread list.
+
+- We now respond to the ThreadExtraInfo request from gdb with the thread
+  name from task_struct .comm.  This then appears in the thread list.
+  Thoughts on additional options for this are welcome.  Things such as
+  "has BKL" and "Preempted" come to mind.  I think we could have a flag
+  word that could enable different bits of info here.
+
+- We now honor, sort of, the C and S commands.  These are continue and
+  single set after delivering a signal.  We ignore the signal and do the
+  requested action.  This only happens when we told gdb that a signal
+  was the reason for entry, which is only done on memory faults.  The
+  result is that you can now continue into the Oops.
+
+- We changed the -g to -gdwarf-2.  This seems to be the same as -ggdb,
+  but it is more exact on what language to use.
+
+- We added two dwarf2 include files and a bit of code at the end of
+  entry.S.  This does not yet work, so it is disabled.  Still we want to
+  keep track of the code and "maybe" someone out there can fix it.
+
+- Randy Dunlap sent some fix ups for this file which are now merged.
+
+- Hugh Dickins sent a fix to a bit of code in traps.c that prevents a
+  compiler warning if CONFIG_KGDB is off (now who would do that :).
+
+- Andrew Morton sent a fix for the serial driver which is now merged.
+
+- Andrew also sent a change to the stub around the cpu managment code
+  which is also merged.
+
+- Andrew also sent a patch to make "f" as well as "g" work as SysRq
+  commands to enter kgdb, merged.
+
+- If CONFIG_KGDB and CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCKS are both set we added a
+  "who" field to the spinlock data struct.  This is filled with
+  "current" when ever the spinlock suceeds.  Useful if you want to know
+  who has the lock.
+
+_ And last, but not least, we fixed the "get_cu" macro to properly get
+  the current value of "current".
+
+New features:
+============
+20030505.1827.27
+We are starting to align with the sourceforge version, at least in
+commands.  To this end, the boot command string to start kgdb at
+boot time has been changed from "kgdb" to "gdb".
+
+Andrew Morton sent a couple of patches which are now included as follows:
+1.) We now return a flag to the interrupt handler.
+2.) We no longer use smp_num_cpus (a conflict with the lock meter).
+3.) And from William Lee Irwin III <wli@holomorphy.com> code to make
+    sure high-mem is set up before we attempt to register our interrupt
+    handler.
+We now include asm/kgdb.h from config.h so you will most likely never
+have to include it.  It also 'NULLS' the kgdb macros you might have in
+your code when CONFIG_KGDB is not defined.  This allows you to just
+turn off CONFIG_KGDB to turn off all the kgdb_ts() calls and such.
+This include is conditioned on the machine being an x86 so as to not
+mess with other archs.
+
+20020801.1129.03
+This is currently the version for the 2.4.18 (and beyond?) kernel.
+
+We have several new "features" beginning with this version:
+
+1.) Kgdb now syncs the "other" CPUs with a cross-CPU NMI.  No more
+    waiting and it will pull that guy out of an IRQ off spin lock :)
+
+2.) We doctored up the code that tells where a task is waiting and
+    included it so that the "info thread" command will show a bit more
+    than "schedule()".  Try it...
+
+3.) Added the ability to call a function from gdb.  All the standard gdb
+    issues apply, i.e. if you hit a breakpoint in the function, you are
+    not allowed to call another (gdb limitation, not kgdb).  To help
+    this capability we added a memory allocation function.  Gdb does not
+    return this memory (it is used for strings that you pass to that function
+    you are calling from gdb) so we fixed up a way to allow you to
+    manually return the memory (see below).
+
+4.) Kgdb time stamps (kgdb_ts()) are enhanced to expand what was the
+    interrupt flag to now also include the preemption count and the
+    "in_interrupt" info.  The flag is now called "with_pif" to indicate
+    the order, preempt_count, in_interrupt, flag.  The preempt_count is
+    shifted left by 4 bits so you can read the count in hex by dropping
+    the low order digit.  In_interrupt is in bit 1, and the flag is in
+    bit 0.
+
+5.) The command: "p kgdb_info" is now expanded and prints something
+    like:
+(gdb) p kgdb_info
+$2 = {used_malloc = 0, called_from = 0xc0107506, entry_tsc = 67468627259,
+  errcode = 0, vector = 3, print_debug_info = 0, hold_on_sstep = 1,
+  cpus_waiting = {{task = 0xc027a000, pid = 32768, hold = 0,
+      regs = 0xc027bf84}, {task = 0x0, pid = 0, hold = 0, regs = 0x0}}}
+
+    Things to note here: a.) used_malloc is the amount of memory that
+    has been malloc'ed to do calls from gdb.  You can reclaim this
+    memory like this: "p kgdb_info.used_malloc=0" Cool, huh?  b.)
+    cpus_waiting is now "sized" by the number of CPUs you enter at
+    configure time in the kgdb configure section.  This is NOT used
+    anywhere else in the system, but it is "nice" here.  c.)  The task's
+    "pid" is now in the structure.  This is the pid you will need to use
+    to decode to the thread id to get gdb to look at that thread.
+    Remember that the "info thread" command prints a list of threads
+    wherein it numbers each thread with its reference number followed
+    by the thread's pid.  Note that the per-CPU idle threads actually
+    have pids of 0 (yes, there is more than one pid 0 in an SMP system).
+    To avoid confusion, kgdb numbers these threads with numbers beyond
+    the MAX_PID.  That is why you see 32768 and above.
+
+6.) A subtle change, we now provide the complete register set for tasks
+    that are active on the other CPUs.  This allows better trace back on
+    those tasks.
+
+    And, let's mention what we could not fix.  Back-trace from all but the
+    thread that we trapped will, most likely, have a bogus entry in it.
+    The problem is that gdb does not recognize the entry code for
+    functions that use "current" near (at all?) the entry.  The compiler
+    is putting the "current" decode as the first two instructions of the
+    function where gdb expects to find %ebp changing code.  Back trace
+    also has trouble with interrupt frames.  I am talking with Daniel
+    Jacobowitz about some way to fix this, but don't hold your breath.
+
+20011220.0050.35
+Major enhancement with this version is the ability to hold one or more
+CPUs in an SMP system while allowing the others to continue.  Also, by
+default only the current CPU is enabled on single-step commands (please
+note that gdb issues single-step commands at times other than when you
+use the si command).
+
+Another change is to collect some useful information in
+a global structure called "kgdb_info".  You should be able to just:
+
+p kgdb_info
+
+although I have seen cases where the first time this is done gdb just
+prints the first member but prints the whole structure if you then enter
+CR (carriage return or enter).  This also works:
+
+p *&kgdb_info
+
+Here is a sample:
+(gdb) p kgdb_info
+$4 = {called_from = 0xc010732c, entry_tsc = 32804123790856, errcode = 0,
+  vector = 3, print_debug_info = 0}
+
+"Called_from" is the return address from the current entry into kgdb.
+Sometimes it is useful to know why you are in kgdb, for example, was
+it an NMI or a real breakpoint?  The simple way to interrogate this
+return address is:
+
+l *0xc010732c
+
+which will print the surrounding few lines of source code.
+
+"Entry_tsc" is the CPU TSC on entry to kgdb (useful to compare to the
+kgdb_ts entries).
+
+"errcode" and "vector" are other entry parameters which may be helpful on
+some traps.
+
+"print_debug_info" is the internal debugging kgdb print enable flag.  Yes,
+you can modify it.
+
+In SMP systems kgdb_info also includes the "cpus_waiting" structure and
+"hold_on_step":
+
+(gdb) p kgdb_info
+$7 = {called_from = 0xc0112739, entry_tsc = 1034936624074, errcode = 0,
+  vector = 2, print_debug_info = 0, hold_on_sstep = 1, cpus_waiting = {{
+      task = 0x0, hold = 0, regs = 0x0}, {task = 0xc71b8000, hold = 0,
+      regs = 0xc71b9f70}, {task = 0x0, hold = 0, regs = 0x0}, {task = 0x0,
+      hold = 0, regs = 0x0}, {task = 0x0, hold = 0, regs = 0x0}, {task = 0x0,
+      hold = 0, regs = 0x0}, {task = 0x0, hold = 0, regs = 0x0}, {task = 0x0,
+      hold = 0, regs = 0x0}}}
+
+"Cpus_waiting" has an entry for each CPU other than the current one that
+has been stopped.  Each entry contains the task_struct address for that
+CPU, the address of the regs for that task and a hold flag.  All these
+have the proper typing so that, for example:
+
+p *kgdb_info.cpus_waiting[1].regs
+
+will print the registers for CPU 1.
+
+"Hold_on_sstep" is a new feature with this version and comes up set or
+true.  What this means is that whenever kgdb is asked to single-step all
+other CPUs are held (i.e. not allowed to execute).  The flag applies to
+all but the current CPU and, again, can be changed:
+
+p kgdb_info.hold_on_sstep=0
+
+restores the old behavior of letting all CPUs run during single-stepping.
+
+Likewise, each CPU has a "hold" flag, which if set, locks that CPU out
+of execution.  Note that this has some risk in cases where the CPUs need
+to communicate with each other.  If kgdb finds no CPU available on exit,
+it will push a message thru gdb and stay in kgdb.  Note that it is legal
+to hold the current CPU as long as at least one CPU can execute.
+
+20010621.1117.09
+This version implements an event queue.  Events are signaled by calling
+a function in the kgdb stub and may be examined from gdb.  See EVENTS
+below for details.  This version also tightens up the interrupt and SMP
+handling to not allow interrupts on the way to kgdb from a breakpoint
+trap.  It is fine to allow these interrupts for user code, but not
+system debugging.
+
+Version
+=======
+
+This version of the kgdb package was developed and tested on
+kernel version 2.4.16.  It will not install on any earlier kernels.
+It is possible that it will continue to work on later versions
+of 2.4 and then versions of 2.5 (I hope).
+
+
+Debugging Setup
+===============
+
+Designate one machine as the "development" machine.  This is the
+machine on which you run your compiles and which has your source
+code for the kernel.  Designate a second machine as the "target"
+machine.  This is the machine that will run your experimental
+kernel.
+
+The two machines will be connected together via a serial line out
+one or the other of the COM ports of the PC.  You will need the
+appropriate modem eliminator (null modem) cable(s) for this.
+
+Decide on which tty port you want the machines to communicate, then
+connect them up back-to-back using the null modem cable.  COM1 is
+/dev/ttyS0 and COM2 is /dev/ttyS1. You should test this connection
+with the two machines prior to trying to debug a kernel.  Once you
+have it working, on the TARGET machine, enter:
+
+setserial /dev/ttyS0 (or what ever tty you are using)
+
+and record the port address and the IRQ number.
+
+On the DEVELOPMENT machine you need to apply the patch for the kgdb
+hooks.  You have probably already done that if you are reading this
+file.
+
+On your DEVELOPMENT machine, go to your kernel source directory and do
+"make Xconfig" where X is one of "x", "menu", or "".  If you are
+configuring in the standard serial driver, it must not be a module.
+Either yes or no is ok, but making the serial driver a module means it
+will initialize after kgdb has set up the UART interrupt code and may
+cause a failure of the control-C option discussed below.  The configure
+question for the serial driver is under the "Character devices" heading
+and is:
+
+"Standard/generic (8250/16550 and compatible UARTs) serial support"
+
+Go down to the kernel debugging menu item and open it up.  Enable the
+kernel kgdb stub code by selecting that item.  You can also choose to
+turn on the "-ggdb -O1" compile options.  The -ggdb causes the compiler
+to put more debug info (like local symbols) in the object file.  On the
+i386 -g and -ggdb are the same so this option just reduces to "O1".  The
+-O1 reduces the optimization level.  This may be helpful in some cases,
+be aware, however, that this may also mask the problem you are looking
+for.
+
+The baud rate.  Default is 115200.  What ever you choose be sure that
+the host machine is set to the same speed.  I recommend the default.
+
+The port.  This is the I/O address of the serial UART that you should
+have gotten using setserial as described above.  The standard COM1 port
+(3f8) using IRQ 4 is default.  COM2 is 2f8 which by convention uses IRQ
+3.
+
+The port IRQ (see above).
+
+Stack overflow test.  This option makes a minor change in the trap,
+system call and interrupt code to detect stack overflow and transfer
+control to kgdb if it happens.  (Some platforms have this in the
+baseline code, but the i386 does not.)
+
+You can also configure the system to recognize the boot option
+"console=kgdb" which if given will cause all console output during
+booting to be put thru gdb as well as other consoles.  This option
+requires that gdb and kgdb be connected prior to sending console output
+so, if they are not, a breakpoint is executed to force the connection.
+This will happen before any kernel output (it is going thru gdb, right),
+and will stall the boot until the connection is made.
+
+You can also configure in a patch to SysRq to enable the kGdb SysRq.
+This request generates a breakpoint.  Since the serial port IRQ line is
+set up after any serial drivers, it is possible that this command will
+work when the control-C will not.
+
+Save and exit the Xconfig program.  Then do "make clean" , "make dep"
+and "make bzImage" (or whatever target you want to make).  This gets the
+kernel compiled with the "-g" option set -- necessary for debugging.
+
+You have just built the kernel on your DEVELOPMENT machine that you
+intend to run on your TARGET machine.
+
+To install this new kernel, use the following installation procedure.
+Remember, you are on the DEVELOPMENT machine patching the kernel source
+for the kernel that you intend to run on the TARGET machine.
+
+Copy this kernel to your target machine using your usual procedures.  I
+usually arrange to copy development:
+/usr/src/linux/arch/i386/boot/bzImage to /vmlinuz on the TARGET machine
+via a LAN based NFS access.  That is, I run the cp command on the target
+and copy from the development machine via the LAN.  Run Lilo (see "man
+lilo" for details on how to set this up) on the new kernel on the target
+machine so that it will boot!  Then boot the kernel on the target
+machine.
+
+On the DEVELOPMENT machine, create a file called .gdbinit in the
+directory /usr/src/linux.  An example .gdbinit file looks like this:
+
+shell echo -e "\003" >/dev/ttyS0
+set remotebaud 38400 (or what ever speed you have chosen)
+target remote /dev/ttyS0
+
+
+Change the "echo" and "target" definition so that it specifies the tty
+port that you intend to use.  Change the "remotebaud" definition to
+match the data rate that you are going to use for the com line.
+
+You are now ready to try it out.
+
+Boot your target machine with "kgdb" in the boot command i.e. something
+like:
+
+lilo> test kgdb
+
+or if you also want console output thru gdb:
+
+lilo> test kgdb console=kgdb
+
+You should see the lilo message saying it has loaded the kernel and then
+all output stops.  The kgdb stub is trying to connect with gdb.  Start
+gdb something like this:
+
+
+On your DEVELOPMENT machine, cd /usr/src/linux and enter "gdb vmlinux".
+When gdb gets the symbols loaded it will read your .gdbinit file and, if
+everything is working correctly, you should see gdb print out a few
+lines indicating that a breakpoint has been taken.  It will actually
+show a line of code in the target kernel inside the kgdb activation
+code.
+
+The gdb interaction should look something like this:
+
+    linux-dev:/usr/src/linux# gdb vmlinux
+    GDB is free software and you are welcome to distribute copies of it
+     under certain conditions; type "show copying" to see the conditions.
+    There is absolutely no warranty for GDB; type "show warranty" for details.
+    GDB 4.15.1 (i486-slackware-linux),
+    Copyright 1995 Free Software Foundation, Inc...
+    breakpoint () at i386-stub.c:750
+    750     }
+    (gdb)
+
+You can now use whatever gdb commands you like to set breakpoints.
+Enter "continue" to start your target machine executing again.  At this
+point the target system will run at full speed until it encounters
+your breakpoint or gets a segment violation in the kernel, or whatever.
+
+If you have the kgdb console enabled when you continue, gdb will print
+out all the console messages.
+
+The above example caused a breakpoint relatively early in the boot
+process.  For the i386 kgdb it is possible to code a break instruction
+as the first C-language point in init/main.c, i.e. as the first instruction
+in start_kernel().  This could be done as follows:
+
+#include <asm/kgdb.h>
+	 breakpoint();
+
+This breakpoint() is really a function that sets up the breakpoint and
+single-step hardware trap cells and then executes a breakpoint.  Any
+early hard coded breakpoint will need to use this function.  Once the
+trap cells are set up they need not be set again, but doing it again
+does not hurt anything, so you don't need to be concerned about which
+breakpoint is hit first.  Once the trap cells are set up (and the kernel
+sets them up in due course even if breakpoint() is never called) the
+macro:
+
+BREAKPOINT;
+
+will generate an inline breakpoint.  This may be more useful as it stops
+the processor at the instruction instead of in a function a step removed
+from the location of interest.  In either case <asm/kgdb.h> must be
+included to define both breakpoint() and BREAKPOINT.
+
+Triggering kgdbstub at other times
+==================================
+
+Often you don't need to enter the debugger until much later in the boot
+or even after the machine has been running for some time.  Once the
+kernel is booted and interrupts are on, you can force the system to
+enter the debugger by sending a control-C to the debug port. This is
+what the first line of the recommended .gdbinit file does.  This allows
+you to start gdb any time after the system is up as well as when the
+system is already at a breakpoint.  (In the case where the system is
+already at a breakpoint the control-C is not needed, however, it will
+be ignored by the target so no harm is done.  Also note the the echo
+command assumes that the port speed is already set.  This will be true
+once gdb has connected, but it is best to set the port speed before you
+run gdb.)
+
+Another simple way to do this is to put the following file in you ~/bin
+directory:
+
+#!/bin/bash
+echo  -e "\003"  > /dev/ttyS0
+
+Here, the ttyS0 should be replaced with what ever port you are using.
+The "\003" is control-C.  Once you are connected with gdb, you can enter
+control-C at the command prompt.
+
+An alternative way to get control to the debugger is to enable the kGdb
+SysRq command.  Then you would enter Alt-SysRq-g (all three keys at the
+same time, but push them down in the order given).  To refresh your
+memory of the available SysRq commands try Alt-SysRq-=.  Actually any
+undefined command could replace the "=", but I like to KNOW that what I
+am pushing will never be defined.
+
+Debugging hints
+===============
+
+You can break into the target machine at any time from the development
+machine by typing ^C (see above paragraph).  If the target machine has
+interrupts enabled this will stop it in the kernel and enter the
+debugger.
+
+There is unfortunately no way of breaking into the kernel if it is
+in a loop with interrupts disabled, so if this happens to you then
+you need to place exploratory breakpoints or printk's into the kernel
+to find out where it is looping.  The exploratory breakpoints can be
+entered either thru gdb or hard coded into the source.  This is very
+handy if you do something like:
+
+if (<it hurts>) BREAKPOINT;
+
+
+There is a copy of an e-mail in the Documentation/i386/kgdb/ directory
+(debug-nmi.txt) which describes how to create an NMI on an ISA bus
+machine using a paper clip.  I have a sophisticated version of this made
+by wiring a push button switch into a PC104/ISA bus adapter card.  The
+adapter card nicely furnishes wire wrap pins for all the ISA bus
+signals.
+
+When you are done debugging the kernel on the target machine it is a
+good idea to leave it in a running state.  This makes reboots faster,
+bypassing the fsck.  So do a gdb "continue" as the last gdb command if
+this is possible.  To terminate gdb itself on the development machine
+and leave the target machine running, first clear all breakpoints and
+continue, then type ^Z to suspend gdb and then kill it with "kill %1" or
+something similar.
+
+If gdbstub Does Not Work
+========================
+
+If it doesn't work, you will have to troubleshoot it.  Do the easy
+things first like double checking your cabling and data rates.  You
+might try some non-kernel based programs to see if the back-to-back
+connection works properly.  Just something simple like cat /etc/hosts
+>/dev/ttyS0 on one machine and cat /dev/ttyS0 on the other will tell you
+if you can send data from one machine to the other.  Make sure it works
+in both directions.  There is no point in tearing out your hair in the
+kernel if the line doesn't work.
+
+All of the real action takes place in the file
+/usr/src/linux/arch/i386/kernel/kgdb_stub.c.  That is the code on the target
+machine that interacts with gdb on the development machine.  In gdb you can
+turn on a debug switch with the following command:
+
+	set remotedebug
+
+This will print out the protocol messages that gdb is exchanging with
+the target machine.
+
+Another place to look is /usr/src/arch/i386/lib/kgdb_serial.c. This is
+the code that talks to the serial port on the target side.  There might
+be a problem there.  In particular there is a section of this code that
+tests the UART which will tell you what UART you have if you define
+"PRNT" (just remove "_off" from the #define PRNT_off).  To view this
+report you will need to boot the system without any beakpoints.  This
+allows the kernel to run to the point where it calls kgdb to set up
+interrupts.  At this time kgdb will test the UART and print out the type
+it finds.  (You need to wait so that the printks are actually being
+printed.  Early in the boot they are cached, waiting for the console to
+be enabled.  Also, if kgdb is entered thru a breakpoint it is possible
+to cause a dead lock by calling printk when the console is locked.  The
+stub thus avoids doing printks from breakpoints, especially in the
+serial code.)  At this time, if the UART fails to do the expected thing,
+kgdb will print out (using printk) information on what failed.  (These
+messages will be buried in all the other boot up messages.  Look for
+lines that start with "gdb_hook_interrupt:".  You may want to use dmesg
+once the system is up to view the log.  If this fails or if you still
+don't connect, review your answers for the port address.  Use:
+
+setserial /dev/ttyS0
+
+to get the current port and IRQ information.  This command will also
+tell you what the system found for the UART type. The stub recognizes
+the following UART types:
+
+16450, 16550, and 16550A
+
+If you are really desperate you can use printk debugging in the
+kgdbstub code in the target kernel until you get it working.  In particular,
+there is a global variable in /usr/src/linux/arch/i386/kernel/kgdb_stub.c
+named "remote_debug".  Compile your kernel with this set to 1, rather
+than 0 and the debug stub will print out lots of stuff as it does
+what it does.  Likewise there are debug printks in the kgdb_serial.c
+code that can be turned on with simple changes in the macro defines.
+
+
+Debugging Loadable Modules
+==========================
+
+This technique comes courtesy of Edouard Parmelan
+<Edouard.Parmelan@quadratec.fr>
+
+When you run gdb, enter the command
+
+source gdbinit-modules
+
+This will read in a file of gdb macros that was installed in your
+kernel source directory when kgdb was installed.  This file implements
+the following commands:
+
+mod-list
+    Lists the loaded modules in the form <module-address> <module-name>
+
+mod-print-symbols <module-address>
+    Prints all the symbols in the indicated module.
+
+mod-add-symbols <module-address> <object-file-path-name>
+    Loads the symbols from the object file and associates them
+    with the indicated module.
+
+After you have loaded the module that you want to debug, use the command
+mod-list to find the <module-address> of your module.  Then use that
+address in the mod-add-symbols command to load your module's symbols.
+From that point onward you can debug your module as if it were a part
+of the kernel.
+
+The file gdbinit-modules also contains a command named mod-add-lis as
+an example of how to construct a command of your own to load your
+favorite module.  The idea is to "can" the pathname of the module
+in the command so you don't have to type so much.
+
+Threads
+=======
+
+Each process in a target machine is seen as a gdb thread. gdb thread
+related commands (info threads, thread n) can be used.
+
+ia-32 hardware breakpoints
+==========================
+
+kgdb stub contains support for hardware breakpoints using debugging features
+of ia-32(x86) processors. These breakpoints do not need code modification.
+They use debugging registers. 4 hardware breakpoints are available in ia-32
+processors.
+
+Each hardware breakpoint can be of one of the following three types.
+
+1. Execution breakpoint - An Execution breakpoint is triggered when code
+	at the breakpoint address is executed.
+
+	As limited number of hardware breakpoints are available, it is
+	advisable to use software breakpoints ( break command ) instead
+	of execution hardware breakpoints, unless modification of code
+	is to be avoided.
+
+2. Write breakpoint - A write breakpoint is triggered when memory
+	location at the breakpoint address is written.
+
+	A write or can be placed for data of variable length. Length of
+	a write breakpoint indicates length of the datatype to be
+	watched. Length is 1 for 1 byte data , 2 for 2 byte data, 3 for
+	4 byte data.
+
+3. Access breakpoint - An access breakpoint is triggered when memory
+	location at the breakpoint address is either read or written.
+
+	Access breakpoints also have lengths similar to write breakpoints.
+
+IO breakpoints in ia-32 are not supported.
+
+Since gdb stub at present does not use the protocol used by gdb for hardware
+breakpoints, hardware breakpoints are accessed through gdb macros. gdb macros
+for hardware breakpoints are described below.
+
+hwebrk	- Places an execution breakpoint
+	hwebrk breakpointno address
+hwwbrk	- Places a write breakpoint
+	hwwbrk breakpointno length address
+hwabrk	- Places an access breakpoint
+	hwabrk breakpointno length address
+hwrmbrk	- Removes a breakpoint
+	hwrmbrk breakpointno
+exinfo	- Tells whether a software or hardware breakpoint has occurred.
+	Prints number of the hardware breakpoint if a hardware breakpoint has
+	occurred.
+
+Arguments required by these commands are as follows
+breakpointno	- 0 to 3
+length		- 1 to 3
+address		- Memory location in hex digits ( without 0x ) e.g c015e9bc
+
+SMP support
+==========
+
+When a breakpoint occurs or user issues a break ( Ctrl + C ) to gdb
+client, all the processors are forced to enter the debugger. Current
+thread corresponds to the thread running on the processor where
+breakpoint occurred.  Threads running on other processor(s) appear
+similar to other non-running threads in the 'info threads' output.
+Within the kgdb stub there is a structure "waiting_cpus" in which kgdb
+records the values of "current" and "regs" for each CPU other than the
+one that hit the breakpoint.  "current" is a pointer to the task
+structure for the task that CPU is running, while "regs" points to the
+saved registers for the task.  This structure can be examined with the
+gdb "p" command.
+
+ia-32 hardware debugging registers on all processors are set to same
+values.  Hence any hardware breakpoints may occur on any processor.
+
+gdb troubleshooting
+===================
+
+1. gdb hangs
+Kill it. restart gdb. Connect to target machine.
+
+2. gdb cannot connect to target machine (after killing a gdb and
+restarting another) If the target machine was not inside debugger when
+you killed gdb, gdb cannot connect because the target machine won't
+respond.  In this case echo "Ctrl+C"(ASCII 3) to the serial line.
+e.g. echo -e "\003" > /dev/ttyS1
+This forces that target machine into the debugger, after which you
+can connect.
+
+3. gdb cannot connect even after echoing Ctrl+C into serial line
+Try changing serial line settings min to 1 and time to 0
+e.g. stty min 1 time 0 < /dev/ttyS1
+Try echoing again
+
+Check serial line speed and set it to correct value if required
+e.g. stty ispeed 115200 ospeed 115200 < /dev/ttyS1
+
+EVENTS
+======
+
+Ever want to know the order of things happening?  Which CPU did what and
+when?  How did the spinlock get the way it is?  Then events are for
+you.  Events are defined by calls to an event collection interface and
+saved for later examination.  In this case, kgdb events are saved by a
+very fast bit of code in kgdb which is fully SMP and interrupt protected
+and they are examined by using gdb to display them.  Kgdb keeps only
+the last N events, where N must be a power of two and is defined at
+configure time.
+
+
+Events are signaled to kgdb by calling:
+
+kgdb_ts(data0,data1)
+
+For each call kgdb records each call in an array along with other info.
+Here is the array definition:
+
+struct kgdb_and_then_struct {
+#ifdef CONFIG_SMP
+	int	on_cpu;
+#endif
+	long long at_time;
+	int  	from_ln;
+	char	* in_src;
+	void	*from;
+        int     with_if;
+	int	data0;
+	int	data1;
+};
+
+For SMP machines the CPU is recorded, for all machines the TSC is
+recorded (gets a time stamp) as well as the line number and source file
+the call was made from.  The address of the (from), the "if" (interrupt
+flag) and the two data items are also recorded.  The macro kgdb_ts casts
+the types to int, so you can put any 32-bit values here.  There is a
+configure option to select the number of events you want to keep.  A
+nice number might be 128, but you can keep up to 1024 if you want.  The
+number must be a power of two.  An "andthen" macro library is provided
+for gdb to help you look at these events.  It is also possible to define
+a different structure for the event storage and cast the data to this
+structure.  For example the following structure is defined in kgdb:
+
+struct kgdb_and_then_struct2 {
+#ifdef CONFIG_SMP
+	int	on_cpu;
+#endif
+	long long at_time;
+	int  	from_ln;
+	char	* in_src;
+	void	*from;
+        int     with_if;
+	struct task_struct *t1;
+	struct task_struct *t2;
+};
+
+If you use this for display, the data elements will be displayed as
+pointers to task_struct entries.  You may want to define your own
+structure to use in casting.  You should only change the last two items
+and you must keep the structure size the same.  Kgdb will handle these
+as 32-bit ints, but within that constraint you can define a structure to
+cast to any 32-bit quantity.  This need only be available to gdb and is
+only used for casting in the display code.

+KGDB over ethernet

+
+
+Introduction
+------------
+
+KGDB supports debugging over ethernet (kgdboe) via polling of a given
+network interface. Most cards should be supported automatically.
+Debugging facilities are available as soon as the network driver and
+kgdboe have initialized. Unfortunately, this is too late in the boot
+process for debugging some issues, but works quite well for many
+others. This should not interfere with normal network usage and
+doesn't require a dedicated NIC.
+
+Terminology
+-----------
+
+This document uses the following terms:
+
+  TARGET: the machine being debugged.
+  HOST:   the machine running gdb.
+
+
+Usage
+-----
+
+You need to use the following command-line option on the TARGET kernel:
+
+  kgdboe=[tgt-port]@<tgt-ip>/[dev],[host-port]@<host-ip>/[host-macaddr]
+
+    where
+        tgt-port      source for UDP packets (defaults to 6443)
+        tgt-ip        source IP to use (interface address)
+        dev           network interface (eth0)
+        host-port     HOST UDP port (6442) (not really used)
+        host-ip       IP address for HOST machine
+        host-macaddr  ethernet MAC address for HOST (ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff)
+
+  examples:
+
+    kgdboe=7000@192.168.0.1/eth1,7001@192.168.0.2/00:05:3C:04:47:5D
+        this machine is 192.168.0.1 on eth1
+        remote machine is 192.168.0.2 with MAC address 00:05:3C:04:47:5D
+        listen for gdb packets on port 7000
+        send unsolicited gdb packets to port 7001
+
+    kgdboe=@192.168.0.1/,@192.168.0.2/
+        this machine is 192.168.0.1 on default interface eth0
+        remote machine is 192.168.0.2, use default broadcast MAC address
+        listen for gdb packets on default port 6443
+        send unsolicited gdb packets to port 6442
+
+Only packets originating from the configured HOST IP address will be
+accepted by the debugger.
+
+On the HOST side, run gdb as normal and use a remote UDP host as the
+target:
+
+   % gdb ./vmlinux
+   GNU gdb Red Hat Linux (5.3post-0.20021129.18rh)
+   Copyright 2003 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
+   GDB is free software, covered by the GNU General Public License, and you are
+   welcome to change it and/or distribute copies of it under certain conditions.
+   Type "show copying" to see the conditions.
+   There is absolutely no warranty for GDB.  Type "show warranty" for details.
+   This GDB was configured as "i386-redhat-linux-gnu"...
+   (gdb) target remote udp:HOSTNAME:6443
+
+You can now continue as if you were debugging over a serial line.
+
+Limitations
+-----------
+
+The current release of this code is exclusive of using kgdb on a
+serial interface, so you must boot without the kgdboe option to use
+serial debugging. Trying to debug the network driver while using it
+will prove interesting.
+
+Bug reports
+-----------
+
+Send bug reports to Robert Walsh <rjwalsh@durables.org> and Matt
+Mackall <mpm@selenic.com>.

+	  This option includes an option in the SysRq code that allows
+	  you to enter SysRq G which generates a breakpoint to the KGDB
+	  stub.  This will work if the keyboard is alive and can
+	  interrupt the system.  Because of constraints on when the
+	  serial port interrupt can be enabled, this code may allow you
+	  to interrupt the system before the serial port control C is
+	  available.  Just say yes here.

+ *  Module name: remcom.c $
+ *  Revision: 1.34 $
+ *  Date: 91/03/09 12:29:49 $
+ *  Contributor:     Lake Stevens Instrument Division$
+ *
+ *  Description:     low level support for gdb debugger. $
+ *
+ *  Considerations:  only works on target hardware $
+ *
+ *  Written by:	     Glenn Engel $
+ *  Updated by:	     David Grothe <dave@gcom.com>
+ *  Updated by:	     Robert Walsh <rjwalsh@durables.org>
+ *  Updated by:	     wangdi <wangdi@clusterfs.com>
+ *  ModuleState:     Experimental $
+ *
+ *  NOTES:	     See Below $
+ *
+ *  Modified for 386 by Jim Kingdon, Cygnus Support.
+ *  Compatibility with 2.1.xx kernel by David Grothe <dave@gcom.com>
+ *
+ *  Changes to allow auto initilization.  All that is needed is that it
+ *  be linked with the kernel and a break point (int 3) be executed.
+ *  The header file <asm/kgdb.h> defines BREAKPOINT to allow one to do
+ *  this. It should also be possible, once the interrupt system is up, to
+ *  call putDebugChar("+").  Once this is done, the remote debugger should
+ *  get our attention by sending a ^C in a packet. George Anzinger
+ *  <george@mvista.com>
+ *  Integrated into 2.2.5 kernel by Tigran Aivazian <tigran@sco.com>
+ *  Added thread support, support for multiple processors,
+ *	support for ia-32(x86) hardware debugging.
+ *	Amit S. Kale ( akale@veritas.com )
+ *
+ *  Modified to support debugging over ethernet by Robert Walsh
+ *  <rjwalsh@durables.org> and wangdi <wangdi@clusterfs.com>, based on
+ *  code by San Mehat.
+ *
+ *
+ *  To enable debugger support, two things need to happen.  One, a
+ *  call to set_debug_traps() is necessary in order to allow any breakpoints
+ *  or error conditions to be properly intercepted and reported to gdb.
+ *  Two, a breakpoint needs to be generated to begin communication.  This
+ *  is most easily accomplished by a call to breakpoint().  Breakpoint()
+ *  simulates a breakpoint by executing an int 3.
+ *
+ *************
+ *
+ *    The following gdb commands are supported:
+ *
+ * command	    function				   Return value
+ *
+ *    g		    return the value of the CPU registers  hex data or ENN
+ *    G		    set the value of the CPU registers	   OK or ENN
+ *
+ *    mAA..AA,LLLL  Read LLLL bytes at address AA..AA	   hex data or ENN
+ *    MAA..AA,LLLL: Write LLLL bytes at address AA.AA	   OK or ENN
+ *
+ *    c		    Resume at current address		   SNN	 ( signal NN)
+ *    cAA..AA	    Continue at address AA..AA		   SNN
+ *
+ *    s		    Step one instruction		   SNN
+ *    sAA..AA	    Step one instruction from AA..AA	   SNN
+ *
+ *    k		    kill
+ *
+ *    ?		    What was the last sigval ?		   SNN	 (signal NN)
+ *
+ * All commands and responses are sent with a packet which includes a
+ * checksum.  A packet consists of
+ *
+ * $<packet info>#<checksum>.
+ *
+ * where
+ * <packet info> :: <characters representing the command or response>
+ * <checksum>	 :: < two hex digits computed as modulo 256 sum of <packetinfo>>
+ *
+ * When a packet is received, it is first acknowledged with either '+' or '-'.
+ * '+' indicates a successful transfer.	 '-' indicates a failed transfer.
+ *
+ * Example:
+ *
+ * Host:		  Reply:
+ * $m0,10#2a		   +$00010203040506070809101112131415#42

+ * (such as the pointer to regs, for example).
+
+ * So here is what we do:
+ * We detect gdb attempting to store into the stack area and instead, store
+ * into the fn_call_lookaside.array at the same relative location as if it
+ * were the area ESP pointed at.  We also trap ESP modifications
+ * and uses these to adjust fn_call_lookaside.esp.  On entry
+ * fn_call_lookaside.esp will be set to point at the last entry in
+ * fn_call_lookaside.array.  This allows us to check if it has changed, and
+ * if so, on exit, we add the registers we will use to do the move and a
+ * trap/ interrupt return exit sequence.  We then adjust the eflags in the
+ * regs array (remember we now have a copy in the fn_call_lookaside.array) to
+ * kill the interrupt bit, AND we change EIP to point at our set up stub.
+ * As part of the register set up we preset the registers to point at the
+ * begining and end of the fn_call_lookaside.array, so all the stub needs to
+ * do is move words from the array to the stack until ESP= the desired value
+ * then do the rti.  This will then transfer to the desired function with
+ * all the correct registers.  Nifty huh?

+	  If you say Y here, the system will be compiled with the debug

+	  kernel.  This stub communicates with gdb on another (host)
+	  computer via a serial port.  The host computer should have
+	  access to the kernel binary file (vmlinux) and a serial port
+	  that is connected to the target machine.  Gdb can be made to
+	  configure the serial port or you can use stty and setserial to
+	  do this. See the 'target' command in gdb. This option also
+	  configures in the ability to request a breakpoint early in the
+	  boot process.  To request the breakpoint just include 'kgdb'
+	  as a boot option when booting the target machine.  The system
+	  will then break as soon as it looks at the boot options.  This
+	  option also installs a breakpoint in panic and sends any
+	  kernel faults to the debugger. For more information see the

+	  This option includes an option in the SysRq code that allows

+	  to interrupt the system before the serial port control C is
+	  available.  Just say yes here.

+ *  Module name: remcom.c $
+ *  Revision: 1.34 $
+ *  Date: 91/03/09 12:29:49 $
+ *  Contributor:     Lake Stevens Instrument Division$
+ *
+ *  Description:     low level support for gdb debugger. $
+ *
+ *  Considerations:  only works on target hardware $
+ *
+ *  Written by:	     Glenn Engel $
+ *  Updated by:	     David Grothe <dave@gcom.com>
+ *  Updated by:	     Robert Walsh <rjwalsh@durables.org>
+ *  Updated by:	     wangdi <wangdi@clusterfs.com>
+ *  ModuleState:     Experimental $
+ *
+ *  NOTES:	     See Below $
+ *
+ *  Modified for 386 by Jim Kingdon, Cygnus Support.
+ *  Compatibility with 2.1.xx kernel by David Grothe <dave@gcom.com>
+ *
+ *  Changes to allow auto initilization.  All that is needed is that it
+ *  be linked with the kernel and a break point (int 3) be executed.
+ *  The header file <asm/kgdb.h> defines BREAKPOINT to allow one to do
+ *  this. It should also be possible, once the interrupt system is up, to
+ *  call putDebugChar("+").  Once this is done, the remote debugger should
+ *  get our attention by sending a ^C in a packet. George Anzinger
+ *  <george@mvista.com>
+ *  Integrated into 2.2.5 kernel by Tigran Aivazian <tigran@sco.com>
+ *  Added thread support, support for multiple processors,
+ *	support for ia-32(x86) hardware debugging.
+ *	Amit S. Kale ( akale@veritas.com )
+ *
+ *  Modified to support debugging over ethernet by Robert Walsh
+ *  <rjwalsh@durables.org> and wangdi <wangdi@clusterfs.com>, based on
+ *  code by San Mehat.
+ *
+ *  X86_64 changes from Andi Kleen's patch merged by Jim Houston
+ * 	(jim.houston@ccur.com).  If it works thank Andi if its broken
+ * 	blame me.
+ *
+ *  To enable debugger support, two things need to happen.  One, a
+ *  call to set_debug_traps() is necessary in order to allow any breakpoints
+ *  or error conditions to be properly intercepted and reported to gdb.
+ *  Two, a breakpoint needs to be generated to begin communication.  This
+ *  is most easily accomplished by a call to breakpoint().  Breakpoint()
+ *  simulates a breakpoint by executing an int 3.
+ *
+ *************
+ *
+ *    The following gdb commands are supported:
+ *
+ * command	    function				   Return value
+ *
+ *    g		    return the value of the CPU registers  hex data or ENN
+ *    G		    set the value of the CPU registers	   OK or ENN
+ *
+ *    mAA..AA,LLLL  Read LLLL bytes at address AA..AA	   hex data or ENN
+ *    MAA..AA,LLLL: Write LLLL bytes at address AA.AA	   OK or ENN
+ *
+ *    c		    Resume at current address		   SNN	 ( signal NN)
+ *    cAA..AA	    Continue at address AA..AA		   SNN
+ *
+ *    s		    Step one instruction		   SNN
+ *    sAA..AA	    Step one instruction from AA..AA	   SNN
+ *
+ *    k		    kill
+ *
+ *    ?		    What was the last sigval ?		   SNN	 (signal NN)
+ *
+ * All commands and responses are sent with a packet which includes a
+ * checksum.  A packet consists of
+ *
+ * $<packet info>#<checksum>.
+ *
+ * where
+ * <packet info> :: <characters representing the command or response>
+ * <checksum>	 :: < two hex digits computed as modulo 256 sum of <packetinfo>>
+ *
+ * When a packet is received, it is first acknowledged with either '+' or '-'.
+ * '+' indicates a successful transfer.	 '-' indicates a failed transfer.
+ *
+ * Example:
+ *
+ * Host:		  Reply:
+ * $m0,10#2a		   +$00010203040506070809101112131415#42

+ * Gdb calls functions by pushing agruments, including a return address
+ * on the stack and the adjusting EIP to point to the function.	 The
+ * whole assumption in GDB is that we are on a different stack than the
+ * one the "user" i.e. code that hit the break point, is on.  This, of
+ * course is not true in the kernel.  Thus various dodges are needed to
+ * do the call without directly messing with EIP (which we can not change
+ * as it is just a location and not a register.	 To adjust it would then
+ * require that we move every thing below EIP up or down as needed.  This
+ * will not work as we may well have stack relative pointer on the stack
+ * (such as the pointer to regs, for example).
+
+ * So here is what we do:
+ * We detect gdb attempting to store into the stack area and instead, store
+ * into the fn_call_lookaside.array at the same relative location as if it
+ * were the area ESP pointed at.  We also trap ESP modifications
+ * and uses these to adjust fn_call_lookaside.esp.  On entry
+ * fn_call_lookaside.esp will be set to point at the last entry in
+ * fn_call_lookaside.array.  This allows us to check if it has changed, and
+ * if so, on exit, we add the registers we will use to do the move and a
+ * trap/ interrupt return exit sequence.  We then adjust the eflags in the
+ * regs array (remember we now have a copy in the fn_call_lookaside.array) to
+ * kill the interrupt bit, AND we change EIP to point at our set up stub.
+ * As part of the register set up we preset the registers to point at the
+ * begining and end of the fn_call_lookaside.array, so all the stub needs to
+ * do is move words from the array to the stack until ESP= the desired value
+ * then do the rti.  This will then transfer to the desired function with
+ * all the correct registers.  Nifty huh?
