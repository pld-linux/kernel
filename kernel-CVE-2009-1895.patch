personality: fix PER_CLEAR_ON_SETID (CVE-2009-1895)

commit f9fabcb58a6d26d6efde842d1703ac7cfa9427b6 upstream.

We have found that the current PER_CLEAR_ON_SETID mask on Linux doesn't
include neither ADDR_COMPAT_LAYOUT, nor MMAP_PAGE_ZERO.

The current mask is READ_IMPLIES_EXEC|ADDR_NO_RANDOMIZE.

We believe it is important to add MMAP_PAGE_ZERO, because by using this
personality it is possible to have the first page mapped inside a
process running as setuid root.  This could be used in those scenarios:

 - Exploiting a NULL pointer dereference issue in a setuid root binary
 - Bypassing the mmap_min_addr restrictions of the Linux kernel: by
   running a setuid binary that would drop privileges before giving us
   control back (for instance by loading a user-supplied library), we
   could get the first page mapped in a process we control.  By further
   using mremap and mprotect on this mapping, we can then completely
   bypass the mmap_min_addr restrictions.

Less importantly, we believe ADDR_COMPAT_LAYOUT should also be added
since on x86 32bits it will in practice disable most of the address
space layout randomization (only the stack will remain randomized).
