+Grsecurity
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC
+  If you say Y here, you will be able to configure many features that
+  will enhance the security of your system.  It is highly recommended
+  that you say Y here and read through the help for each option so
+  you fully understand what it's doing and can evaluate its usefulness
+  for your machine.
+
+Additional security levels
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_LOW
+
+  Low additional security
+  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
+  If you choose this option, several of the grsecurity options will
+  be enabled that will give you greater protection against a number
+  of attacks, while assuring that none of your software will have any 
+  conflicts with the additional security measures.  If you run a lot of 
+  unusual software, or you are having problems with the higher security 
+  levels, you should say Y here.  With this option, the following features
+  are enabled:
+  
+  linking restrictions
+  fifo restrictions
+  secure fds
+  random pids
+  enforcing nproc on execve()
+  restricted dmesg
+  random ip ids
+  enforced chdir("/") on chroot
+  secure keymap loading
+
+  Medium additional security
+  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
+  If you say Y here, several features in addition to those included in the 
+  low additional security level will be enabled.  These features provide
+  even more security to your system, though in rare cases they may
+  be incompatible with very old or poorly written software.  If you 
+  enable this option, make sure that your auth service (identd) is 
+  running as gid 10 (usually group wheel). With this option the following 
+  features (in addition to those provided in the low additional security 
+  level) will be enabled:
+
+  random tcp source ports
+  altered ping ids
+  failed fork logging
+  time change logging
+  signal logging
+  deny mounts in chroot
+  deny double chrooting
+  deny mknod in chroot
+  /proc restrictions with special gid set to 10 (usually wheel)
+  pax's random mmap
+
+  High additional security
+  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
+  If you say Y here, many of the features of grsecurity will be enabled,
+  that will protect you against virtually all kinds of attacks against
+  your system.  The much hightened security comes at a cost of an 
+  increased chance of incompatabilities with rare software on your 
+  machine.  It is highly recommended that you view 
+  <http://grsecurity.net/features.htm> and read about each option.  Since 
+  this security level enabled PaX, you should also view 
+  <http://pageexec.virtualave.net> and read about the PaX project.  While 
+  you are there, download chpax.c and run chpax -p on binaries that cause 
+  problems with PaX.  Also remember that since the /proc restrictions are 
+  enabled, you must run your identd as group wheel (gid 10).  The 
+  grsecurity ACL system is also enabled in this level.  To learn how to 
+  correctly configure it, view the ACL documentation on 
+  <http://grsecurity.net>.  This security level enables the following 
+  features in addition to those listed in the low and medium security 
+  levels:
+
+  grsecurity ACL system
+  additional /proc restrictions
+  signal restrictions in chroot
+  chmod restrictions in chroot
+  no ptrace in chroot
+  priority restrictions in chroot
+  PaX - random mmap, noexec on all memory pages, restricted mprotect
+  fixed mmap restrictions
+  mount/unmount/remount logging
+  restricted ptrace (only root and users in group wheel (gid 10) are 
+  allowed to ptrace)
+
+Customized additional security
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_CUSTOM
+  If you say Y here, you will be able to configure every grsecurity 
+  option, which allows you to enable many more features that aren't 
+  covered in the basic security levels.  These additional features include 
+  TPE, socket restrictions, and the sysctl system for grsecurity.  It is 
+  advised that you read through the help for each option to determine its 
+  usefulness in your situation.
+
+OpenWall Non-executable Stack
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_STACK
+  If you say Y here, your system will not allow execution of
+  code on the stack, making buffer overflow exploitation more difficult.
+  The code for this protection is taken from the Openwall patch for
+  linux 2.2 by Solar Designer. You can view his projects at 
+  <http://www.openwall.com/linux>.
+  Exploits against your machine with this protection will have to dabble 
+  in more obscure methods of exploitation(bss,got,heap..)
+
+Gcc trampoline support
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_STACK_GCC
+  If you say Y here, the system will support trampoline code along
+  with the stack protection.  If you do not have any programs on
+  your system that require this (glibc 2.0 users must say YES to
+  this option) you may say no here.
+
+PaX protection
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_PAX 
+  By design the IA-32 architecture does not allow for protecting
+  memory pages against execution, i.e. if a page is readable (such
+  as the stack or heap) it is also executable.  There is a well
+  known exploit technique that makes use of this fact and a common
+  programming mistake where an attacker can introduce executable
+  code of his choice somewhere in the attacked program's memory
+  (typically the stack or the heap) and then execute it.  If the
+  attacked program was running with different (typically higher)
+  privileges than that of the attacker, then he can elevate his
+  own privilege level (e.g. get a root shell, write to files for
+  which he does not have write access to, etc).
+
+  Since the implementation is software based, it comes with a
+  performance impact, you should evaluate your system carefully
+  before deciding to use this feature on production systems.
+
+  Enabling this feature will enforce the non-executable flag on
+  memory pages thereby making it harder to execute 'foreign' code
+  in a program.  This will also break programs that rely on the
+  old behaviour and expect that dynamically allocated memory via
+  the malloc() family of functions is executable (which it is not).
+  Notable examples are the XFree86 4.x server, the java runtime
+  and wine.
+
+  NOTE: you can use the 'chpax' utility to enable/disable this
+  feature on a per file basis.  chpax is available at
+  <http://pageexec.virtualave.net>
+
+Emulate trampolines
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_PAX_EMUTRAMP
+  There are some programs and libraries that for one reason or
+  another attempt to execute special small code snippets from
+  non-executable memory pages.  Most notable examples are the
+  signal handler return code generated by the kernel itself and
+  the GCC trampolines.
+
+  If you enabled CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_PAX then such programs will no
+  longer work under your kernel.  As a remedy you can say Y here
+  and use the 'chpax' utility to enable trampoline emulation for
+  the affected programs yet still have the protection provided by
+  CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_PAX.  Alternatively you can say N here and use
+  the 'chpax' utility to disable CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_PAX for the
+  affected files.  chpax is available at 
+  <http://pageexec.virtualave.net>
+
+  NOTE: enabling this feature *may* open up a loophole in the
+  protection provided by CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_PAX that an attacker
+  could abuse.  Therefore the best solution is to not have any
+  files on your system that would require this option.  This can
+  be achieved by not using libc5 (which relies on the kernel
+  signal handler return code) and not using or rewriting programs
+  that make use of the nested function implementation of GCC.
+  Skilled users can just fix GCC itself so that it implements
+  nested function calls in a way that does not interfere with PaX.
+
+Restrict mprotect()
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_PAX_MPROTECT
+  Enabling this option will prevent programs from changing the
+  executable status of memory pages that were not originally
+  created as executable.  The kernel will also prevent programs
+  from making read-only executable pages writable again.
+
+  You should say Y here to complete the protection provided by
+  the enforcement of the PAGE_EXEC flag (CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_PAX).
+
+  NOTE: you can use the 'chpax' utility to enable/disable this
+  feature on a per file basis. chpax is available at
+  <http://pageexec.virtualave.net>
+
+Randomize mmap() base
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_PAX_RANDMMAP
+  By saying Y here the kernel will somewhat randomize the address
+  space layout of programs at each execution (the top of the stack, the
+  base address for mmap() requests that do not specify one themselves
+  and the base address of dynamic ELF executables).
+
+  As a result all dynamically loaded libraries will appear at random
+  addresses and therefore be harder to exploit by a technique where
+  an attacker attempts to execute library code for his purposes
+  (e.g. spawn a shell from an exploited program that is running at
+  an elevated privilege level).
+
+  Furthermore, if a program is relinked as a dynamic ELF file, its
+  base address layout will be randomized as well, completing the full
+  randomization of the address space.  Attacking such programs becomes
+  a guess game.
+
+  It is strongly recommended to say Y here even if CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_PAX
+  is not enabled as address space layout randomization has negligible 
+  impact on performance yet it provides a very effective protection.
+
+  NOTE: you can use the 'chpax' utility to enable/disable this
+  feature on a per file basis.  chpax is available at
+  <http://pageexec.virtualave.net>
+
+Read-only kernel memory
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_KMEM
+  If you say Y here, root will not be able to modify the contents of
+  kernel memory.  If module support is removed in addition to enabling 
+  this option, the ability of an attacker to insert foreign code into 
+  a running kernel is removed.
+
+Fixed mmap restrictions
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_MMAPFIXED
+  If you say Y here, it will be impossible for an attacker to bypass the
+  PaX buffer overflow protection by mmaping an executable memory region
+  with a specific address set.
+
+Proc Restrictions
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_PROC
+  If you say Y here, the permissions of the /proc filesystem
+  will be altered to enhance system security and privacy.  Depending
+  upon the options you choose, you can either restrict users to see
+  only the processes they themselves run, or choose a group that can
+  view all processes and files normally restricted to root if you choose
+  the "restrict to user only" option.  NOTE: If you're running identd as 
+  a non-root user, you will have to run it as the group you specify here.
+
+Restrict /proc to user only
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_PROC_USER
+  If you say Y here, non-root users will only be able to view their own 
+  processes, and restricts them from viewing network-related information,  
+  and viewing kernel symbol and module information.
+
+Restrict /proc to user and group
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_PROC_USERGROUP
+  If you say Y here, you will be able to select a group that will be
+  able to view all processes, network-related information, and
+  kernel and symbol information.  This option is useful if you want
+  to run identd as a non-root user.
+
+Additional proc restrictions
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_PROC_ADD
+  If you say Y here, additional restrictions will be placed on
+  /proc that keep normal users from viewing cpu and device information.
+
+Dmesg(8) Restriction
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_DMESG
+  If you say Y here, non-root users will not be able to use dmesg(8)
+  to view up to the last 4kb of messages in the kernel's log buffer.
+  If the sysctl option is enabled, a sysctl option with name "dmesg" is 
+  created.
+
+Linking restrictions
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_LINK
+  If you say Y here, /tmp race exploits will be prevented, since users
+  will no longer be able to follow symlinks owned by other users in 
+  world-writeable +t directories (i.e. /tmp), unless the owner of the 
+  symlink is the owner of the directory. users will also not be
+  able to hardlink to files they do not own.  If the sysctl option is
+  enabled, a sysctl option with name "linking_restrictions" is created.
+
+FIFO restrictions
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_FIFO
+  If you say Y here, users will not be able to write to FIFOs they don't
+  own in world-writeable +t directories (i.e. /tmp), unless the owner of
+  the FIFO is the same owner of the directory it's held in.  If the sysctl
+  option is enabled, a sysctl option with name "fifo_restrictions" is 
+  created.
+
+Secure file descriptors
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_FD
+  If you say Y here, binaries will be protected from data spoofing
+  attacks (eg. making a program read /etc/shadow).  The patches do this
+  by opening up /dev/null to any of the stdin, stdout, stderr file descriptors
+  for binaries that are open.  If the sysctl option is enabled, a sysctl 
+  option with name "secure_fds" is created.
+
+Exec process limiting
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_EXECVE
+  If you say Y here, users with a resource limit on processes will
+  have the value checked during execve() calls.  The current system
+  only checks the system limit during fork() calls.  If the sysctl option
+  is enabled, a sysctl option with name "execve_limiting" is created.
+
+Fork-bombing protection
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_FORKBOMB
+  If you say Y here, you will be able to configure a group to add to users
+  on your system that you want to be unable to fork-bomb the system.
+  You will be able to specify a maximum process limit for the user and
+  set a rate limit for all forks under their uid. (Fork-bombing is a
+  tactic used by attackers that can be enacted in two ways, (1) loading
+  up thousands of processes until the system can't take any more (this
+  method can be stopped outside of the kernel with PAM, however we place
+  protection for it in the kernel to be more complete and reduce overhead),
+  and (2), by forking processes at a rapid rate, and then killing them
+  off, which cannot be protected against in the same way at tactic 1)
+  The rate limit is specified in forks allowed per second.  Set this
+  limit low enough to stop tactic 2, but high enough to allow for
+  normal operation.  The protection will kill the offending process.
+  If the sysctl option is enabled, a sysctl option with name 
+  "fork_bomb_prot" is created.
+
+Max processes for fork-bomb protection
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_FORKBOMB_MAX
+  Here you can configure the maximum number of processes users in the
+  fork-bomb protected group can run.  I would not recommend setting a
+  value lower than 8, since some programs like man(1) spawn up to 8
+  processes to run.  The default value should be fine for most purposes.
+  If the sysctl option is enabled, a sysctl option with name
+  "fork_bomb_max" is created.
+
+Forks allowed per second
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_FORKBOMB_SEC
+  Here you can specify the maximum number of forks allowed per second.
+  You don't want to set this value too low, or else you'll hinder
+  normal operation of your system.  The default value should be fine for
+  most users.  If the sysctl option is enabled, a sysctl option with name
+  "fork_bomb_sec" is created.
+
+Group for fork-bomb protection
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_FORKBOMB_GID
+  Here you can choose the GID to enable fork-bomb protection for.
+  Remember to add the users you want protection enabled for to the GID 
+  specified here.  If the sysctl option is enabled, whatever you choose
+  here won't matter. You'll have to specify the GID in your bootup 
+  script by echoing the GID to the proper /proc entry.  View the help
+  on the sysctl option for more information.  If the sysctl option is
+  enabled, a sysctl option with name "fork_bomb_gid" is created.
+
+Single group for auditing
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_AUDIT_GROUP
+  If you say Y here, the exec, chdir, (un)mount, and ipc logging features
+  will only operate on a group you specify.  This option is recommended
+  if you only want to watch certain users instead of having a large
+  amount of logs from the entire system.  If the sysctl option is enabled,
+  a sysctl option with name "audit_group" is created.
+
+GID for auditing
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_AUDIT_GID
+  Here you can choose the GID that will be the target of kernel auditing.
+  Remember to add the users you want to log to the GID specified here.
+  If the sysctl option is enabled, whatever you choose here won't matter. 
+  You'll have to specify the GID in your bootup script by echoing the GID 
+  to the proper /proc entry.  View the help on the sysctl option for more 
+  information.  If the sysctl option is enabled, a sysctl option with name 
+  "audit_gid" is created.
+
+Chdir logging
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_AUDIT_CHDIR
+  If you say Y here, all chdir() calls will be logged.  If the sysctl 
+  option is enabled, a sysctl option with name "audit_chdir" is created.
+
+(Un)Mount logging
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_AUDIT_MOUNT
+  If you say Y here, all mounts and unmounts will be logged.  If the 
+  sysctl option is enabled, a sysctl option with name "audit_mount" is 
+  created.
+
+IPC logging
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_AUDIT_IPC
+  If you say Y here, creation and removal of message queues, semaphores,
+  and shared memory will be logged.  If the sysctl option is enabled, a
+  sysctl option with name "audit_ipc" is created.
+
+Exec logging
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_EXECLOG
+  If you say Y here, all execve() calls will be logged (since the
+  other exec*() calls are frontends to execve(), all execution
+  will be logged).  Useful for shell-servers that like to keep track
+  of their users.  If the sysctl option is enabled, a sysctl option with
+  name "exec_logging" is created.
+  WARNING: This option when enabled will produce a LOT of logs, especially
+  on an active system.
+
+Set*id logging
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_SUID
+  If you say Y here, all set*id() calls will be logged.  Such information
+  could be useful when detecting a possible intrusion attempt.  This 
+  option can produce a lot of logs on an active system.  If the sysctl
+  option is enabled, a sysctl option with name "suid_logging" is created.
+
+Log set*ids to root
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_SUID_ROOT
+  If you say Y here, only set*id() calls where a user is changing to the
+  gid or uid of the root user will be logged.  Such information
+  could be useful when detecting a possible intrusion attempt.  This
+  option will produce less logs than logging all calls.  If the sysctl
+  option is enabled, a sysctl option with name "suid_root_logging" is
+  created.
+
+Altered default IPC permissions
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_IPC
+  If you say Y here, the default permissions for IPC objects will be
+  set based on the filesystem umask of the user creating the object.
+  By default linux sets the permissions to ugo+rwx, which can be
+  a security problem if the application doesn't explicitly set the
+  permissions of the IPC object.  Since this change affects programs
+  using IPC, it might break some programs that are expecting the
+  default permission behavior.  It is known to break Apache 1.3.22.
+
+Signal logging
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_SIGNAL
+  If you say Y here, certain important signals will be logged, such as
+  SIGSEGV, which will as a result inform you of when a error in a program
+  occurred, which in some cases could mean a possible exploit attempt.
+  If the sysctl option is enabled, a sysctl option with name 
+  "signal_logging" is created.
+
+BSD-style coredumps
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_COREDUMP
+  If you say Y here, linux will use a style similar to BSD for
+  coredumps, core.processname.  Not a security feature, just
+  a useful one.  If the sysctl option is enabled, a sysctl option with 
+  name "coredump" is created.
+
+Fork failure logging
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_FORKFAIL
+  If you say Y here, all failed fork() attempts will be logged.
+  This could suggest a fork bomb, or someone attempting to overstep
+  their process limit.  If the sysctl option is enabled, a sysctl option
+  with name "forkfail_logging" is created.
+
+Time change logging
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_TIME
+  If you say Y here, any changes of the system clock will be logged.
+  If the sysctl option is enabled, a sysctl option with name 
+  "timechange_logging" is created.
+
+Secure keymap loading
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_KBMAP
+  If you say Y here, KDSKBENT and KDSKBSENT ioctl calls being
+  called by unprivileged users will be denied. If you answer N,
+  everyone with access to the console will be able to modify keyboard 
+  bindings.  If the sysctl option is enabled, a sysctl option with name
+  "secure_kbmap" is created.
+
+Chroot jail restrictions
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_CHROOT
+  If you say Y here, you will be able to choose several options that will
+  make breaking out of a chrooted jail much more difficult.  If you
+  encounter no software incompatibilities with the following options, it
+  is recommended that you enable each one.
+
+Restricted signals in chroot
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_CHROOT_SIG
+  If you say Y here, processes inside a chroot will not be able to send
+  signals outside of the chroot.  The only signals allowed are null 
+  signals which perform no action, and the parent process sending 
+  a certain signal to its child.  If the sysctl option is enabled, a
+  sysctl option with name "chroot_restrict_sigs" is created.
+
+Deny mounts in chroot
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_CHROOT_MOUNT
+  If you say Y here, processes inside a chroot will not be able to
+  mount or remount filesystems.  If the sysctl option is enabled, a 
+  sysctl option with name "chroot_deny_mount" is created.
+
+Deny double-chroots
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_CHROOT_DOUBLE
+  If you say Y here, processes inside a chroot will not be able to chroot
+  again.  This is a widely used method of breaking out of a chroot jail
+  and should not be allowed.  If the sysctl option is enabled, a sysctl
+  option with name "chroot_deny_chroot" is created.
+
+Enforce chdir("/") on all chroots
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_CHROOT_CHDIR
+  If you say Y here, the current working directory of all newly-chrooted
+  applications will be set to the the root directory of the chroot.
+  The man page on chroot(2) states:
+  Note that this call does not change  the  current  working
+  directory,  so  that `.' can be outside the tree rooted at
+  `/'.  In particular, the  super-user  can  escape  from  a
+  `chroot jail' by doing `mkdir foo; chroot foo; cd ..'.  
+
+  It is recommended that you say Y here, since it's not known to break
+  any software.  If the sysctl option is enabled, a sysctl option with
+  name "chroot_enforce_chdir" is created.
+
+Deny (f)chmod +s in chroot
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_CHROOT_CHMOD
+  If you say Y here, processes inside a chroot will not be able to chmod
+  or fchmod files to make them have suid or sgid bits.  This protects 
+  against another published method of breaking a chroot.  If the sysctl 
+  option is enabled, a sysctl option with name "chroot_deny_chmod" is
+  created.
+
+Deny mknod in chroot
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_CHROOT_MKNOD
+  If you say Y here, processes inside a chroot will not be allowed to
+  mknod.  The problem with using mknod inside a chroot is that it
+  would allow an attacker to create a device entry that is the same
+  as one on the physical root of your system, which could range from
+  anyhing from the console device to a device for your harddrive (which
+  they could then use to wipe the drive or steal data).  It is recommended
+  that you say Y here, unless you run into software incompatibilities.
+  If the sysctl option is enabled, a sysctl option with name
+  "chroot_deny_mknod" is created.
+
+Deny ptraces in chroot
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_CHROOT_PTRACE
+  If you say Y here, processes inside a chroot will not be able to ptrace
+  other processes.  Ptracing a process allows one to attach and alter the
+  flow of execution for the process.  It is strongly recommended that you
+  say Y here.  If the sysctl option is enabled, a sysctl option with name
+  "chroot_deny_ptrace" is created.
+
+Restrict priority changes in chroot
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_CHROOT_NICE
+  If you say Y here, processes inside a chroot will not be able to raise
+  the priority of processes in the chroot, or alter the priority of 
+  processes outside the chroot.  This provides more security than simply
+  removing CAP_SYS_NICE from the process' capability set.  If the
+  sysctl option is enabled, a sysctl option with name "chroot_restrict_nice"
+  is created.
+
+Log all execs within chroot
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_CHROOT_EXECLOG
+  If you say Y here, all executions inside a chroot jail will be logged 
+  to syslog.  If the sysctl option is enabled, a sysctl option with name
+  "chroot_execlog" is created.
+
+Chroot jail capability restrictions
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_CHROOT_CAPS
+  If you say Y here, the capabilities on all root processes within a
+  chroot jail will be lowered to stop module insertion, raw i/o,
+  system and net admin tasks, rebooting the system, modifying immutable 
+  files, and changing the system time.  This is left an option because it 
+  can break some apps.  Disable this if your chrooted apps are having
+  problems performing those kinds of tasks.  If the sysctl option is 
+  enabled, a sysctl option with name "chroot_caps" is created.
+
+Trusted path execution
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_TPE
+  If you say Y here, you will be able to choose a gid to add to the
+  supplementary groups of users you want to mark as "untrusted."
+  These users will not be able to execute any files that are not in
+  root-owned directories writeable only by root.  If the sysctl option
+  is enabled, a sysctl option with name "tpe" is created.
+
+Group for trusted path execution
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_TPE_GID
+  Here you can choose the GID to enable trusted path protection for.
+  Remember to add the users you want protection enabled for to the GID 
+  specified here.  If the sysctl option is enabled, whatever you choose
+  here won't matter. You'll have to specify the GID in your bootup 
+  script by echoing the GID to the proper /proc entry.  View the help
+  on the sysctl option for more information.  If the sysctl option is
+  enabled, a sysctl option with name "tpe_gid" is created.
+
+Partially restrict non-root users
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_TPE_ALL
+  If you say Y here, All non-root users other than the ones in the 
+  group specified in the main TPE option will only be allowed to
+  execute files in directories they own that are not group or
+  world-writeable, or in directories owned by root and writeable only by
+  root.  If the sysctl option is enabled, a sysctl option with name 
+  "tpe_restrict_all" is created.
+
+Trusted path execution glibc protection
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_TPE_GLIBC
+  If you say Y here, all non-root users executing any files while 
+  glibc specific environment variables such as LD_PRELOAD are set, 
+  will have their environment cleared of these variables, since they 
+  could be used to evade the trusted path execution protection.  It also 
+  protects against evasion through executing the dynamic linker to run a 
+  rogue binary.  It is recommended you say Y here also. If the sysctl 
+  option is enabled, a sysctl option with name "tpe_glibc" is created.
+
+Ptrace logging
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_AUDIT_PTRACE
+  If you say Y here, all successful ptraces will be logged.  Ptraces are 
+  special operations performed when programs like strace or gdb are run.  
+  They have also been the focus of some kernel vulnerabilities.  If the 
+  sysctl option is enabled, a sysctl option with name "audit_ptrace" is 
+  created.
+
+Restricted ptrace
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_PTRACE
+  If you say Y here, no one but root will be able to ptrace processes.
+  Tracing syscalls inside the kernel will also be disabled.  If the 
+  sysctl option is enabled, a sysctl option with name "restrict_ptrace" 
+  is created.
+
+Allow ptrace for group
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_PTRACE_GROUP
+  If you say Y here, you will be able to choose a GID of whose users
+  will be able to ptrace.  If the sysctl option is enabled, a sysctl 
+  option with name "allow_ptrace_group" is created.
+
+GID for ptrace
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_PTRACE_GID
+  Here you can choose the GID of whose users will be able to ptrace.
+  Remember to add the users you want ptrace enabled for to the GID
+  specified here.  If the sysctl option is enabled, whatever you choose
+  here won't matter. You'll have to specify the GID in your bootup
+  script by echoing the GID to the proper /proc entry.  View the help
+  on the sysctl option for more information.  If the sysctl option is
+  enabled, a sysctl option with name "ptrace_gid" is created.
+
+Randomized PIDs
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_RANDPID
+  If you say Y here, all PIDs created on the system will be
+  pseudo-randomly generated.  This is extremely effective along
+  with the /proc restrictions to disallow an attacker from guessing
+  pids of daemons, etc.  PIDs are also used in some cases as part
+  of a naming system for temporary files, so this option would keep
+  those filenames from being predicted as well.  We also use code
+  to make sure that PID numbers aren't reused too soon.  If the sysctl
+  option is enabled, a sysctl option with name "rand_pids" is created.
+
+Limit uid/gid changes to root
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_TTYROOT
+  If you say Y here, you will be able choose from three option that
+  will allow you to restrict access to the root account by console
+  type.  These options should only be enabled if you are sure of what
+  you're doing.  Also note that they only apply to processes that have
+  ttys, which generally involves some kind of user-interaction.  The
+  options are basically in place to keep users on a system who have a
+  (stolen) password for root from using it unless their console
+  credentials match.
+
+Deny physical consoles (tty)
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_TTYROOT_PHYS
+  If you say Y here, access to root from physical consoles will be
+  denied. This is only recommended for rare cases where you will
+  never need to be physically at the machine.  If the sysctl option
+  is enabled, a sysctl option with name "deny_phys_root" is created.
+
+Deny serial consoles (ttyS)
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_TTYROOT_SERIAL
+  If you say Y here, access to root from serial consoles will be
+  denied. Most people can say Y here, since most don't use serial
+  devices for their console access.  If you are unsure, say N.  If
+  the sysctl option is enabled, a sysctl option with name 
+  "deny_serial_root" is created.
+
+Deny pseudo consoles (pty)
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_TTYROOT_PSEUDO
+  If you say Y here, access to root from pseudo consoles will be
+  denied. Pseudo consoles include consoles from telnet, ssh, or any other
+  kind of interactive shell initiated from the network.  Pseudo consoles
+  also include any terminals you use in XFree86.  If you will only be
+  accessing the machine for root access from the physical console, you
+  can say Y here.  Only say Y here if you're sure of what you're doing.
+  If the sysctl option is enabled, a sysctl option with name 
+  "deny_pseudo_root" is created.
+
+Randomized IP IDs
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_RANDID
+  If you say Y here, all the id field on all outgoing packets
+  will be randomized.  This hinders os fingerprinters and
+  keeps your machine from being used as a bounce for an untraceable
+  portscan.  Ids are used for fragmented packets, fragments belonging
+  to the same packet have the same id.  By default linux only
+  increments the id value on each packet sent to an individual host.
+  We use a port of the OpenBSD random ip id code to achieve the
+  randomness, while keeping the possibility of id duplicates to
+  near none.  If the sysctl option is enabled, a sysctl option with name
+  "rand_ip_ids" is created.
+
+Randomized TCP source ports
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_RANDSRC
+  If you say Y here, situations where a source port is generated on the
+  fly for the TCP protocol (ie. with connect() ) will be altered so that
+  the source port is generated at random, instead of a simple incrementing
+  algorithm.  If the sysctl option is enabled, a sysctl option with name
+  "rand_tcp_src_ports" is created.
+
+Randomized RPC XIDs
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_RANDRPC
+  If you say Y here, the method of determining XIDs for RPC requests will
+  be randomized, instead of using linux's default behavior of simply
+  incrementing the XID.  If you want your RPC connections to be more
+  secure, say Y here.  If the sysctl option is enabled, a sysctl option 
+  with name "rand_rpc" is created.
+
+Altered Ping IDs
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_RANDPING
+  If you say Y here, the way Linux handles echo replies will be changed
+  so that the reply uses an ID equal to the ID of the echo request.
+  This will help in confusing OS detection.  If the sysctl option is
+  enabled, a sysctl option with name "altered_pings" is created.
+
+Randomized TTL
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_RANDTTL
+  If you say Y here, your TTL (time to live) for packets will be set at
+  random, with a base of the sysctl ttl default, to further confuse OS 
+  detection. If the sysctl option is enabled, a sysctl option with name 
+  "rand_ttl" is created.
+
+Socket restrictions
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_SOCKET
+  If you say Y here, you will be able to choose from several options.
+  If you assign a GID on your system and add it to the supplementary
+  groups of users you want to restrict socket access to, this patch
+  will perform up to three things, based on the option(s) you choose.
+
+Deny all socket access
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_SOCKET_ALL
+  If you say Y here, you will be able to choose a GID of whose users will
+  be unable to connect to other hosts from your machine or run server
+  applications from your machine.  If the sysctl option is enabled, a
+  sysctl option with name "socket_all" is created.
+
+Group for disabled socket access
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_SOCKET_ALL_GID
+  Here you can choose the GID to disable socket access for. Remember to 
+  add the users you want socket access disabled for to the GID 
+  specified here.  If the sysctl option is enabled, whatever you choose
+  here won't matter. You'll have to specify the GID in your bootup 
+  script by echoing the GID to the proper /proc entry.  View the help
+  on the sysctl option for more information.  If the sysctl option is
+  enabled, a sysctl option with name "socket_all_gid" is created.
+
+Deny all client socket access
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_SOCKET_CLIENT
+  If you say Y here, you will be able to choose a GID of whose users will
+  be unable to connect to other hosts from your machine, but will be
+  able to run servers.  If this option is enabled, all users in the group
+  you specify will have to use passive mode when initiating ftp transfers
+  from the shell on your machine.  If the sysctl option is enabled, a
+  sysctl option with name "socket_client" is created.
+
+Group for disabled client socket access
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_SOCKET_CLIENT_GID
+  Here you can choose the GID to disable client socket access for. 
+  Remember to add the users you want client socket access disabled for to 
+  the GID specified here.  If the sysctl option is enabled, whatever you 
+  choose here won't matter. You'll have to specify the GID in your bootup 
+  script by echoing the GID to the proper /proc entry.  View the help
+  on the sysctl option for more information.  If the sysctl option is
+  enabled, a sysctl option with name "socket_client_gid" is created.
+
+Deny all server socket access
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_SOCKET_SERVER
+  If you say Y here, you will be able to choose a GID of whose users will
+  be unable to run server applications from your machine.  If the sysctl 
+  option is enabled, a sysctl option with name "socket_server" is created.
+
+Group for disabled server socket access
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_SOCKET_SERVER_GID
+  Here you can choose the GID to disable server socket access for. 
+  Remember to add the users you want server socket access disabled for to 
+  the GID specified here.  If the sysctl option is enabled, whatever you 
+  choose here won't matter. You'll have to specify the GID in your bootup 
+  script by echoing the GID to the proper /proc entry.  View the help
+  on the sysctl option for more information.  If the sysctl option is
+  enabled, a sysctl option with name "socket_server_gid" is created.
+
+Sysctl support
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_SYSCTL
+  If you say Y here, you will be able to change the options that
+  grsecurity runs with at bootup, without having to recompile your
+  kernel.  You can echo values to files in /proc/sys/kernel/grsecurity
+  to enable (1) or disable (0) various features.  All the sysctl entries
+  are mutable until the "grsec_lock" entry is set to a non-zero value.
+  All features are disabled by default. Please note that this option could 
+  reduce the effectiveness of the added security of this patch if an ACL 
+  system is not put in place.  Your init scripts should be read-only, and 
+  root should not have access to adding modules or performing raw i/o 
+  operations.  All options should be set at startup, and the grsec_lock 
+  entry should be set to a non-zero value after all the options are set.  
+  *THIS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT*
+
+Grsecurity ACL System
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_ACL
+  If you say Y here, you enable the Access Control List system for 
+  grsecurity. Unlike many other popular ACL systems, it allows both 
+  process and file ACLs. To use the ACL system, you must also download the 
+  userspace code and documentation off the grsecurity website: 
+  <http://grsecurity.net>  You will then need to run gradm setup to set 
+  your password and create your config files.
+  
+Denied capability logging
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_ACL_CAPLOG
+  If you say Y here, logs will be produced when a root-owned process does 
+  not have a needed capability raised in his set.  This information is 
+  useful when creating ACLs for your system.
+
+Seconds in between log messages
+CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_FLOODTIME
+  This option allows you to enforce the number of seconds between
+  grsecurity log messages.  The default should be suitable for most 
+  people, however, if you choose to change it, choose a value small enough
+  to allow informative logs to be produced, but large enough to
+  prevent flooding.
+
+ACL Debugging Messages
+CONFIG_GR_DEBUG
+  This option allows the grsecurity ACL system to print debugging messages 
+  as an aid to finding problems in your ACL sets.
+
+Extra ACL Debugging Messages
+CONFIG_GR_SUPERDEBUG
+  This option allows you to enable additional debugging messages that can 
+  also help you in finding problems in your ACL sets or to gain a better 
+  understanding of the internal workings of the ACL system.
+
+Path to gradm
+CONFIG_GRADM_PATH
+  This should be set to the path of the gradm binary installed on your
+  system.  If gradm is not yet installed on your system, download
+  gradm from <http://grsecurity.net> and follow the directions in the
+  README.
+
+Maximum tries before password lockout
+CONFIG_GR_MAXTRIES
+  This option enforces the maximum number of times a user can attempt
+  to authorize themselves with the grsecurity ACL system before being
+  denied the ability to attempt authorization again for a specified time.  
+  The lower the number, the harder it will be to brute-force a password.
+
+Time to wait after max password tries, in seconds
+CONFIG_GR_TIMEOUT
+  This option specifies the time the user must wait after attempting to 
+  authorize to the ACL system with the maximum number of invalid 
+  passwords.  The higher the number, the harder it will be to brute-force 
+  a password.
