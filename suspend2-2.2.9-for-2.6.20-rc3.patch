+Suspend2 changelog.
+
+2.2.9 - 24 November 2006
+
+- Remove bdev freezing - XFS users, proceed with caution!
+  I'm told this shouldn't be needed any more as XFS threads are now behaving
+  properly. Let's see.
+- Remove dependancy on CONFIG_PM_DEBUG (All debugging code available always).
+- Don't wait for a keypress if aborting because pageset1 waits too much.
+  We're in the midst of an atomic copy, so can't interact with the user.
+- Related to the previous one, add a new bit in the result code to say that
+  the extra pages allowance was too small.
+- Restore freezing of processes prior to atomic copy at resume time. When did
+  it go missing? (Haven't looked).
+- Add support for aborting if pages need resaving.
+- Don't clear the encryption key and iv when loading plugin configs if they
+  weren't saved in the image.
+- Mark only readonly process pages as pageset2 by default. The old behaviour
+  of marking all process pages as pageset2 (thereby letting you save a large
+  image) can be reenabled by:
+  procsetting full_pageset2 1
+  or
+  echo 1 > /sys/power/suspend2/full_pageset2
+  I think that most people might want this to be the default, but I'll see.
+  Not doing it is theoretically safer, at least until I identify the cause
+  of the few cases that have appeared so far where pageset2 pages do change.
+
+2.2.8.5 - 14 November 2006
+
+- Rework LRU page un/relinking code.
+- Add cryptoapi based hashing for verification that Pageset2 doesn't
+  change while being written. Off by default. To enable:
+  echo 1 > /sys/power/suspend2/checksum/enabled
+  This calculates MD5 checksums for all pageset2 pages prior to starting
+  to save the image and again prior to the atomic copy. If any pages have
+  changed, they will be resaved in the atomic copy, and the original version
+  discarded when the image is reloaded. If checksumming is enabled, the
+  debug info will contain:
+  - Checksum method is 'md5'.
+    0 pages resaved in atomic copy.
+  If the number is non-zero, please contact me - I will be interested to
+  see if we can track down which pages change and why.
+
+2.2.8.4 - 8 November 2006
+
+- Update documentation some more.
+- Completion of renaming 'writers' to 'allocators'.
+
+2.2.8.3 - 7 November 2006
+
+- Freezer.h instead of suspend.h/sched.h used for freezing functions.
+- Select CRYPTO_ALGAPI when LZF chosen.
+- Modifications to freezer.
+- Rename swap and file 'writers' to 'allocators'.
+- Add Redhat copyrights.
+- Cleanup some unused declarations in compression.c.
+- Call read_header_cleanup functions in __read_pageset1 error pages.
+- Fix accounting for number of highmem pages needed.
+- Use swsusp saveable() function.
+- Use drop_pagecache() function for image_size_limit=-2.
+- Make 'Initiating a software suspend cycle' KERN_INFO level.
+- Remove buffer_alloc|free paranoia code.
+- If open_bdev (swap allocator), don't treat device as a string and
+  only display error when we're not going to in the caller.
+- Use DIV_ROUND_UP in dyn_pageflags code.
+- Use kzalloc instead of kmalloc in dyn_pageflags code.
+- printk error if allocating memory for dynamic pageflags fails.
+
+2.2.8.2 - 12 October 2006
+
+- Update internals document and rename to suspend2-internals.txt.
+- Remove device and suspend2 beeping code.
+- Fix compilation issues with !CONFIG_NET.
+- Lots of whitespace cleanups & removal of spurious comments.
+- Remove some now unused members in extent struct and unused variables.
+- Rename struct pagedir pageset_size member to size.
+- Make unsigned longs used in image preparation into ints.
+- Cleanups in unused/unnecessary return values and procedures with just one
+  caller.
+- Rework [de]registering modules.
+- Use DIV_ROUND_UP macro.
+- Revert power_off changes.
+
+2.2.8.1 - 5 October 2006
+
+- Try to make freezing more reliable under load by doing
+  sys_sync after signalling userspace threads the first time,
+  and start the timeout from the completion of the sys_sync.
+- Handle the return value from sysfs_create_file.
+- Reset compression stats on any action so they don't cause
+  confusion in debugging.
+- Poweroff improvements, I hope!
+- Block i/o cleanups - 200 lines less, no problems seen so far!
+- Fix a compilation warning when swsusp and suspend2 are both disabled.
+- Work toward completion of Documentation/power/internals.
+- Correct complain when an initrd lacks echo > do_resume (s/proc/sysfs)
+
+2.2.8 - 20 September 2006
+
+- Add Changelog as Documentation/power/Suspend2-Changelog.txt
+- Don't replace swsusp completely when the do-it-by-default option is on.
+
+2.2.7.6 - 15 September 2006
+
+- Let swsusp work. The readding of BUG_ON(non suspend2 io) test
+  wasn't targetted enough.
+- Fix the swsusp replacement code to work with initramfses.
+- Explicitly case the sizeof(struct suspend_header) as int. One case
+  reported where the lack of a cast seems to have caused huge header
+  size values.
+- Make the suspend_file routine parse_signature static.
+- Fix handling of swapwriter code so that the filewriter can still work
+  with the new swsusp replacement functionality.
+
+2.2.7.5 - 5 September 2006
+
+- Documentation updates
+- Add support for beeping at signficant lowlevel suspending points,
+  to help in diagnosing resume failures.
+  suspend_beep=1 on commandline to activate.
+- Add support for beeping while invoking driver suspend and resume
+  routines, to help in diagnosing resume failures.
+  Boot with device_beep=1 to activate.
+- Add a timer_resume fix that I'm hoping to see John Stultz submit
+  upstream.
+- Readd BUG_ON(non suspend2 io during suspend) in response to a
+  recent corruption report.
+- Remove deflate fix. We were the only ones needing it, and I don't
+  recommend the use of glacially slow compression anyway.
+- Remove PPC SOFTWARE_REPLACE_SLEEP configuration option.
+- Better typing of pageflags variables.
+- Use max_pfn rather than -1 to indicate the start/end of a scan.
+- Remove LRU paranoia. No reports of it being hit.
+- Consolidate Suspend2 specific kernel/power/*.h.
+- Unlink LRU pages instead of avoiding vmscanning during suspend.
+- Make Suspend2 a drop-in replacement for swsusp (compile time
+  option). This doesn't stop swsusp from working. Instead it lets you
+  * use resume= instead of resume2= (resume= takes precedence if set)
+  * use noresume instead of noresume2
+  * use echo disk > /sys/power/state to activate suspend2.
+  By default suspend2 is configured to use lzf compression, if available,
+  and no encryption.
+  Overriding swsusp can by disabled via /sys/power/suspend2.
+- Add further printks to help diagnose resume issues.
+- Replace zone->spanned_pages with populated_zone() test.
+- Some initial work on code to prove/ensure LRU pages aren't modified
+  while being written. Relies on DEBUG_PAGEALLOC, so shouldn't interfere
+  with normal use of this release, but it isn't working yet. x86 only.
+- Some further cleanups from sysfs conversion.
+
+2.2.7.4 - 19 July 2006
+
+- Update Documentation to refer to /sys/power/suspend2.
+- Make invocation of pm_console_suspend/resume optional
+  and disabled by default.
+- Add some printks for -EBUSY error messages.
+- Rename proc.c to sysfs.c.
+- Apply Rafael's suggestion of using the zone table info.
+- Change .disabled to .enabled in the module structure.
+- Change all references to proc to be sysfs.
+- Add one second delay between powering down devices and
+  doing the acpi state enter/machine_power_off/machine_halt.
+- Add result code flag for drivers failing to suspend.
+
+2.2.7.3 - 11 July 2006
+
+- Add subdirectories for modules.
+- Fix do_suspend and do_resume.
+
+2.2.7.2 - 11 July 2006
+
+- Console suspend and resume fix.
+- Initial sysfs support. /proc support retained for the interim. Note that the
+  sysfs layout is subject to change. I may make subdirectories for the modules
+  (compressor etc) and put their entries in there.
+- Modifed debugging info for compressor and encryptor so it's clearer when the
+  name of the algorithm to be used hasn't been set.
+- Try kernel_halt() if kernel_power_off() fails.
+
+2.2.7.1 - 6 July 2006
+
+- Remove Linus patches.
+- Remove some debugging code from atomic_copy.c
+- Change quotes and remove leading spaces in Kconfig
+- Shift resetting accounting of module header storage usage.
+- Add a missing reset of suspend2_running.
+- Remove some extra whitespace that was used when splitting the patches.
+- Enable some code in dyn_pageflags.c that was disabled and correct a typo
+  in it.
+
+2.2.7 - 2 July 2006
+
+- Fix test debugging patch to run on powering down devices instead of
+  when suspending them, and re-disable interrupts when we find something
+  to complain about.
+
+2.2.6.3 - 2 July 2006
+
+- Add Bernard's 2.2.6.2 fix patch (thanks, Bernard!)
+- Add test debugging patch to capture drivers that reenable irqs when they
+  ought not.
+
+2.2.6.2 - 1 July 2006
+
+- Fix date on last release :)
+- Fix freeze when eating memory that I forgot about before doing 2.2.6.1
+- Small commenting fix.
+- Quieten pdflush when thawed.
+
+2.2.6.1 - 1 July 2006
+
+- Cleanups: Whitespace/line wrapping, removal of asm-ppc/cpu_context.h,
+  old/unnecessary declarations in dyn_pageflags.h, freezer.h. Atomic_copy
+  prepare_pbe_list.
+- Commenting: dyn_pageflags.h
+- Rename: pageflags_space_needed -> suspend_*
+- Add zones_in_use variable, to save recalculating how many zones are in use
+  all the time (ta Rafael).
+- !(CONFIG_VT && VT_CONSOLE) compile fix from LKML.
+- Fix SYSTEM_BOOTING->RUNNING, from old version of Linus' console patch.
+- Quoting of KConfig options. Addresses warnings that have appeared in
+  post 2.6.17 git.
+- Reverse early pm_ops->prepare and late ->finish invocations.
+- Handle errors if bdev freezing kmalloc fails or suspend2_suspend fails.
+- Correct error handling in suspend_main().
+- Remove block_dump debugging in file_writer.
+- Re-enable populate_block_list printk condition.
+- Disable pm_prepare_console and pm_restore_console calls for now. Still
+  seem to be problematic.
+- Add MAINTAINERS file entry.
+
+2.2.6 - 23 June 2006
+
+- No problems reported so far with 2.2.5.3, so I'm
+  renaming it to 2.2.6.
+
+2.2.5.3 - 22 June 2006
+
+- Update to 2.6.17
+- Bring figuring out which pages to save closer to the
+  algorithm used by swsusp.
+- Move allocation of image header storage last in updating
+  the image contents.
+- Reset the header bytes used by each module when getting
+  the request so S3 powerdown doesn't only work once.
+- Tidy header allocation code.
+- Tidy process refreezing when updating the image metadata.
+- Add debugging code to check that LRU pages are not modified
+  while the freezer is on.
+- Do pm_state->prepare and finish right at the start and
+  end of a cycle.
+- Add Ben Collin's patch for a trace data section for ppc
+  (needed for Linus' debugging patch, added in 2.2.5.2).
+- Rework extra pageset1 pages allowance so that we have a
+  hardcoded minimum and default (now 500) that is more
+  easily modified (prepare_image.h).
+- Take pm_sem when suspending and add PM_SEM failure bit
+  to the result code.
+- Use console suspend/resume code.
+
+2.2.5.2 - 16 June 2006
+
+- Remove x86_64 e820 code.
+- Add #include to Linus' tracing code to fix compilation in
+  Ubuntu backport.
+- Add display of number of extra pageset 1 pages used.
+- Modify the code which tracks our position in storage so that
+  it sits at the start of a page and not the end. Simplifies
+  finding where to start when resuming.
+- Add pdflush post-resume fix from LKML.
+
+2.2.5.1 - 15 June 2006
+
+- Updated to 2.6.17-rc6.
+- Fixed filewriter issue when header is not at the lowest block
+  number in the file.
+- Moved refrigerator closer to the vanilla implementation.
+- Removed per-workqueue freezing.
+- Carefully audited header space usage and added debugging
+  support.
+- Fixed compilation issues with sharing code with swsusp.
+- Removed SUSPEND_TEST_BIO flag.
+- Added paragraph to suspend2.txt. Pavel forked, not us :)
+- Removed arm code. No recent updates.
+- Added (temporary) e820 amd64 code.
+- Fix BITMAP_FOR_EACH_SET to check for -1 instead of max_pfn.
+- Add ifdefs around some highmem code.
+- Fix some line length issues.
+- Rename attempt_to_parse_resume_device to suspend_...
+- Remove DEBUG_PAGEALLOC support.
+- Prepare to power off with POWER_OFF, not SUSPEND_DISK.
+- Max extra pages allowance should be INT_MAX, not 32768.
+
+2.2.5 - 21 April 2006
+
+- Cleanups from ongoing preparation of the git tree.
+- Correction to x86_64 page_is_ram function.
+- New FREEZING_COMPLETE status variable, used in debugging the
+  new shrink_all_memory implementation.
+- Improvements to calculations of header space required. More
+  work to be done.
+- Fix compilation with !CONFIG_NET
+- Some new image calculation paranoia. Shouldn't be needed, but
+  you can't always know everything that changes from one kernel
+  version to the next.
+- Use Con Kolivas and Rafael Wysocki's shrink_all_memory rework,
+  with a couple of bug fixes of my own. In combination with this,
+  simplify the memory freeing in suspend2 to use a single pass.
+- Fix suspend_running not being set at resume time, which caused
+  spontaneous reboots when the temporary pagedir allocator then
+  got unsafe pages.
+- Remove setting swap info struct data during resume.
+- Update hooks in the pagealloc routines that prevented memory
+  freeing while we're writing the image.
+
+2.2.4.1 - 13 April 2006
+
+- Removed use of max_pfn to make life simpler on ARM.
+- Fix line length in atomic_copy.c.
+- Rename suspend_recalculate_stats to suspend_recalculate_image_contents
+- Remove checksumming code.
+- Apply Jens Gustedt's checks for which filesystems are mounted
+  on resume.
+- Fix encryption where PAGE_SIZE % key length != 0.
+- Move swsusp Makefile entries below Suspend2 again - it doesn't play
+  nicely with Suspend2, and so needs to have it's boot time routines
+  run later. noresume2 will also not work with noresume being compiled
+  in first.
+- Rework the allocation of extra pages to use PageNosave instead of
+  PageAllocd and don't completely clear Pageset1Copy on every iteration
+  through count_data_pages. 
+- Remove the ConflictingPages bitmap.
+- Remove a bogus comment that said we remember conflicting pages and
+  free them.
+- Remove DEBUG_PAGEALLOC support.
+- Add extra message for when powering off.
+- Rework and cleanup code which determines which pages to save.
+- Correction to ram_to_suspend function - it should halve the
+  amount calculated and take account of extra pagedir pages that have
+  been allocated.
+- Correct handling of proc entries that use longs. This is particularly
+  relevant to the image_size_limit. It wasn't previously correctly set
+  to -1 or -2. (This would have broken the nocaches functionality).
+- Move suspend_default_console_level to ui.c.
+- Remove unused suspend_bio_task in block_io.c.
+- Use progress granularity that was saved in the image header, even
+  if the userui helper program stored in the image header won't be
+  used because it was overridden by the initrd/ramfs script.
+- Don't update the load average while the freezer is on. This fixes
+  an unintended sideeffect wherein mail services will refuse to
+  operate post-resume because the load average had been pushed up
+  by Suspend's intensive CPU use.
+
+2.2.4 - 2 April 2006
+
+- Fixed what are hopefully the last outstanding issues with
+  the switchover to using the swsusp lowlevel code:
+  * Corrected compilation issues with the difference
+    combinations of swsusp and Suspend2.
+  * Make x86_64 work correctly - get_safe_page() was using
+    the swsusp code instead of Suspend2 code.
+
+2.2.3 - 1 April 2006
+
+- Add better powerdown_methods documentation (thanks
+  Jens Gustedt).
+- Further work addressing issues with using the swsusp
+  lowlevel code.
+- Abort on resume if we fail to initialise the compression
+  transform used when suspending.
+- Switch filewriter to use add_to_extent_chain instead of
+  append_extent_to_extent_chain and remove now the now
+  unused function.
+- Fix compilation errors if swsusp and Suspend2 are both
+  disabled.
+- Fix PPC compilation error with !rtas.
+
+2.2.2.1 - 28 March 2006
+
+- Missed a part of the backport, inadvertently making
+  a requirement that you also select
+  CONFIG_SOFTWARE_SUSPEND. Fix that by making Suspend2
+  select SOFTWARE_SUSPEND automatically.
+
+2.2.2 - 28 March 2006
+
+- Backported to 2.6.16.
+- Added a couple of printks for when we fail to write a
+  block of the image. Saw this in unusual circumstances
+  while testing, and need to seek to reproduce and fix.
+
+2.2.1.3 - 27 March 2006
+Prepared against current git as at 7.30pm AEST
+- Further cleanups as I begin to prepare the git tree
+  in earnest.
+- Highmem fixes I almost forgot for this release!
+
+2.2.1.2 - 23 March 2006
+Prepared against current git as at 11pm AEST.
+
+- Further cleanups from the switch to swsusp lowlevel
+  code. Should not longer require swsusp to be selected.
+
+2.2.1.1 - 23 March 2006
+Prepared against current git as at 4:20pm AEST.
+
+- Switch suspend2 to use the swsusp lowlevel code.
+- Rework freeing of extra pages allocated for the
+  atomic copy.
+- Misc cleanups.
+
+2.2.1 - 17 March 2006
+
+- Remove debug_pagealloc support
+- Documentation update
+- Move device_suspend at resume time prior to setting
+  up temporary page tables (Lamarque Souza).
+
+2.2.0.8 - 15 March 2006
+
+- Convert pageset sizes to longs.
+- Convert [read|write]_header_chunk to
+  rw_header_chunk([READ|WRITE]...) and do similar
+  cleanups with other i/o routines.
+- Remove some unused module structure members.
+- Flatten the module ops.
+- Fix a couple of harmless compile warnings.
+
+2.2.0.7 - 15 March 2006
+
+- Further fixes from 2.2.0.6. Now tested with modifying
+  resume2= in an initrd and checking image_exists prior
+  to do the echo > do_resume.
+
+2.2.0.6 - 13 March 2006
+
+- Split logic for determining whether we can suspend from
+  that for figuring out whether we can resume. This is
+  useful for the filewriter, where resume2= can be valid
+  (allowing us to resume) while filewriter_target isn't
+  set (prohibiting suspending).
+- Update file headers.
+
+2.2.0.5 - 13 March 2006
+
+- Oh dear. I somehow reversed the 2.2.0.3 fix in 2.2.0.4.
+  Let's try and get them both in the same patch, shall we?
+
+2.2.0.4 - 13 March 2006
+
+- Fix missing incrementation of # extents freed in new
+  swap storage code.
+
+2.2.0.3 - 11 March 2006
+
+- Add x86 compilation error fix I missed.
+
+2.2.0.2 - 11 March 2006
+
+- Fix minimum free ram at 2000 pages rather than nr pages >> 7.
+- Remove command line suspend_act, suspend_lvl and suspend_dbg
+  options.
+- Fix issues with swap allocation that made suspend not work
+  properly with multiple swap storage at the same priority or
+  highly fragmented storage.
+- Add Randy Dunlap's libata patches (sata).
+- Removed time patches.
+- Documentation updates
+- Remove un-needed x86_64 fix processor context patch.
+- Remove x86_64 mcheck_init invocation.
+- Separate workqueue freezer, dynamic pageflags and
+  lzf patches.
+- Remove obsolete configuration flags from the enums in suspend2.h.
+- Correct various typos in headers.
+- Various cleanups.
+- Remove command line parameters suspend_act, suspend_dbg and
+  suspend_lvl.
+- Remove HALT_ON debugging macro from pagedir.c.
+- Add tags for my new patch splitting utility.
+
+2.2.0.1 - 15 February 2006
+
+- Update to 2.6.16-rc3.
+- Further cleanups, removing fragments that are no longer needed
+  and applying suggestions from code review.
+- Remove Christoph's todo list code. Not because I don't like it,
+  but because it was originally designed to help SMP cleanness,
+  and cpu hotplug has taken over that need.
+
+2.2 - 24 January 2006 (Happy Birthday, Dad!)
+
+- Fix amd64 page_is_ram typo.
+- Fix unintentional dependence on swsusp (amd64).
+- Make swapwriter select swap support instead of depending
+  on it already being selected.
+- Make a new common function for writing the last (partial)
+  page of a header.
+- Remove temporary enabling of block dump when reading pageset1.
+- Extend have_image to also display some of the details from
+  the header.
+- Cleanup count_data_pages changes.
+- Save and restore the block_dump setting when starting/finishing
+  a cycle.
+- Add support for debugging the image header reading & writing.
+- A few fixes to the filewriter.
+- Cleanups in swapwriter and arch specific code.
+
+2.2-rc16 - 8 January 2006
+
+- Small updates to documentation.
+- Fix amd64 support.
+- Remove no-unneeded modifications to fs/super.c & mtrr code.
+- Cleanup dyn pageflags include files.
+- Clean freezer header.
+- Move swsusp to bottom of Makefile to make interoperability work better.
+- Move pm_ops prepare/finish calls back -moving the calls to pre/post
+  hotplugging doesn't seem to be the right thing to do at the moment.
+- Save zone info that's used during atomic restore in memory that can
+  be safely accessed during that period.
+- Modify swsusp so it can be used with the new freezer without causing
+  a deadlock.
+- Reinstate the ability to cancel a suspend part way through writing a
+  pageset.
+- Fix some duplicated allowance for extra pd1 pages.
+- Further work on new PageNoSave code.
+- Increase max outstanding I/O to 2048.
+- Remove some unnecessary forced inlining.
+
+2.2-rc15 - 26 December 2005
+
+- Call the correct writer init routine (read/write were transposed!)
+- Freeze filesystems in reverse order so loopback doesn't result in
+  a hang.
+- Select HOTPLUG_CPU instead of depending on it (SMP).
+- Further switchovers from assuming pfns start at 0 to using per zone
+  ranges.
+- Lots of architecture specific fixes for PPC, x86_64 and ARM.
+- Work on removing PageNosave dependency and changes outside kernel/power.
+- Support new read-only section patches.
+- Remove b44 patch.
+- Cleanups (as always!). This time, we remove driver_model.[ch], and
+  remove some now unused MTRR modifications and lowlevel x86 code.
+- Small modifications to lowlevel code routine.
+- Reintroduce /proc/suspend2/no_pageset2 for testing.
+- Compile fix for !SUSPEND2.
+- Fixups to powerdown code (yes, again!).
+- Bug fix to rw_init_plugins.
+- Small rework of sanity checking.
+- Make num_pcp_pages() numa compatible.
+- Cleanup filesystem freezing code.
+- More consolidation of swapwriter and filewriter code into bio.c.
+- Attempt to parse resume device when checking if can suspend and
+  suspend is currently disabled.
+- Rename noresume_setup to noresume2_setup so it works with swsusp
+  compiled in.
+- Fix filewriter so it again tries to stat the file if name_to_dev_t
+  fails.
+
+2.2-rc14 - 2 December 2005
+
+- Correct header_locations in documentation to headerlocations.
+- Remove BUG_ON() in ll_rw_blk.c.
+- Correction to nvidia agp suspend/resume support.
+- Complete removal of syncthread code.
+- Consolidate all of the page i/o code from swapwriter and
+  filewriter into one version, moved to block_io.c.
+- Combine the io.c read & write pageset routines and make
+  separate routines of plugin setup/cleanup and the main loop.
+- Fix for AMD64 reading wrong block for header at resume time
+  (and thus reporting 0.0.0 kernel version in the image).
+
+2.2-rc13 - 25 November 2005
+
+- Add ARM support, thanks to Hiroki Kaminaga at Sony.
+- Replace remounting with freezing and thawing filesystems.
+- Remove now unneeded syncthread code (more to be done).
+- Don't sys_sync after freezing filesystems. That way lies deadlocks.
+- Beginnings of cleanups for writers.
+- Make number of extra pagedir 1 pages allowed for tunable via a
+  new proc entry. Set it to 0 for autotuning.
+- Fix an oops in the filewriter.
+- Fix for typo in power off code (thanks, _damjan_).
+
+2.2-rc12 - 22 November 2005
+
+- New test_bio proc debugging entry; don't actually write anything,
+  just say where the data would be put.
+- Further filewriter fixes. It should be perfectly usable now,
+  but I would still recommend care and backups!
+- Don't use smp_processor_id in lowlevel code. With cpuhotplug, we
+  know we're on processor zero.
+- Fix some indentation in the lowlevel code.
+- Touch softlockup watchdog when resuming. Shouldn't be needed and
+  doesn't seem to make any difference, but I'll seek consistency
+  with Pavel at this point.
+- Show what processes enter and leave the fridge and when iff
+  PM Debug is enabled (wRAR).
+- Modify remounting logic introduced in rc11 so that syslog etc
+  continue to work postresume.
+- Remove some extra debugging code in the freezer.
+- Prune the number of calls to attempt_to_parse so that we can
+  properly figure out whether suspending should be enabled.
+- Don't unblank the console from the kernel code. Doesn't play
+  nicely with vesafb-tng. 
+
+2.2-rc11 - 15 November 2005
+
+- Remount filesystems readonly while suspending so as to ensure
+  xfs flushes all pending writes. This also means things should
+  be nice and clean if you fail to resume (for whatever reason).
+- Fix highmem support that I broke with rc10.
+- Fix typo in 2nd+ attempt at resuming message.
+
+2.2-rc10 - 14 November 2005
+
+- Increased allowance for extra pagedir1 pages. This is primarily
+  for the new flgrx driver. If you don't use it, you'll see a
+  bigger drop in the total image size after the atomic copy. This
+  is nothing to be concerned about.
+- Some debugging code has been temporarily modified to always
+  print, to help address some particular users' issues.
+- More helpful debugging for AMD64 preemption problems.
+- Rework of powerdown code. Powerdown method can now also be 0,
+  meaning Suspend won't try to use ACPI to powerdown. 1 & 2 are
+  also accepted values. You might find Standby (1) useful, but 2
+  will probably only make the computer resume again immediately.
+- Big rework of blocksize handling. Suspend2 is now tested with the
+  swap files and ordinary files on ext3, xfs and reiser with each
+  blocksize allowed by the filesystem type. Other filesystems should
+  work without a problem because the algorithm is basically the same
+  as that used for swapfiles.
+- Initial version of discontiguous memory support.
+- Replace /proc/software_suspend with /proc/suspend2.
+- Make Suspend2 explicitly depend upon cpu hotplug for SMP.
+- Leave interrupts enabled when powering down.
+- Make storage manager testing proc entry depend on PM_DEBUG.
+- Remove unnecessary check at the start of save image.
+- Small cleanups in the swapwriter (swapfile management).
+
+2.2-rc9 - 5 November 2005
+
+- Filewriter cleanups and bug fixes.
+- Display stats when unable to allocate enough storage, to help diagnosing
+  this issue.
+- Some cleanups to e820 table support.
+- Various small fixes to PPC support.
+- Modifed BIO submission check to be smarter (use new Suspend2 flag in BIO
+  flags).
+- Add userspace storage manager (usm) support. Requires userspace program.
+  None are available yet. This change included a separation of the netlink
+  code from the userui code into a new file.
+- Replace type * name with type *name everywhere.
+- Made debugging code for driver suspend/resume calls more gentle
+  (delay/print instead of BUG_ON().
+- Don't mark image as resumed before when in KEEP_IMAGE made.
+- Seek to address BUG_ONs being hit in marking a task as pageset1.
+- Address some arch/config specific compilation warnings.
+- Use kernel_power_off_prepare instead of device_shutdown when not entering
+  suspend to ram.
+- Thaw kernel processes before beginning to eat memory.
+- Make freezer quiet by default.
+- Export freezer state for when ext3 (eg) built as a module.
+- Add news_storage_manager to proc entry info so that entries that needs
+  access to storage for reading and/or writing can enable it as required.
+  There is also a new activate_storage entry that can be used in a script to
+  avoid having it repetitively enabled and disabled by a number of instructions.
+	echo 1 >  /proc/suspend2/activate_storage
+  at the start of the sequence and
+	echo 0 > /proc/suspend2/activate_storage
+  and the end.
+- Correct bits in result code so hibernate script gives the correct
+  interpretation again.
+- Cleanup and simplify file management in the file writer. (Debugging printks
+  left in for this release).
+- Poke blanked console when resuming.
+

+  come from real cause of err)
+- attempt_to_parse_resume_device should return whether successful
+- Merge plugin read/write inits/cleanups into one loop.
+- Merge read & write routines into one generic I/O loop?

+		Software Suspend 2.2 Internal Documentation.
+				Version 1
+
+1.  Introduction.
+
+    Software Suspend 2.2 is an addition to the Linux Kernel, designed to
+    allow the user to quickly shutdown and quickly boot a computer, without
+    needing to close documents or programs. It is equivalent to the
+    hibernate facility in some laptops. This implementation, however,
+    requires no special BIOS or hardware support.
+
+    The code in these files is based upon the original implementation
+    prepared by Gabor Kuti and additional work by Pavel Machek and a
+    host of others. This code has been substantially reworked by Nigel
+    Cunningham, again with the help and testing of many others, not the
+    least of whom is Michael Frank. At its heart, however, the operation is
+    essentially the same as Gabor's version.
+
+2.  Overview of operation.
+
+    The basic sequence of operations is as follows:
+
+	a. Quiesce all other activity.
+	b. Ensure enough memory and storage space are available, and attempt
+	   to free memory/storage if necessary.
+	c. Allocate the required memory and storage space.
+	d. Write the image.
+	e. Power down.
+
+    There are a number of complicating factors which mean that things are
+    not as simple as the above would imply, however...
+
+    o The activity of each process must be stopped at a point where it will
+    not be holding locks necessary for saving the image, or unexpectedly
+    restart operations due to something like a timeout and thereby make
+    our image inconsistent.
+
+    o It is desirous that we sync outstanding I/O to disk before calculating
+    image statistics. This reduces corruption if one should suspend but
+    then not resume, and also makes later parts of the operation safer (see
+    below).
+
+    o We need to get as close as we can to an atomic copy of the data.
+    Inconsistencies in the image will result in inconsistent memory contents at
+    resume time, and thus in instability of the system and/or file system
+    corruption. This would appear to imply a maximum image size of one half of
+    the amount of RAM, but we have a solution... (again, below).
+
+    o In 2.6, we choose to play nicely with the other suspend-to-disk
+    implementations.
+
+3.  Detailed description of internals.
+
+    a. Quiescing activity.
+
+    Safely quiescing the system is achieved using two methods.
+
+    First, we note that the vast majority of processes don't need to run during
+    suspend. They can be 'frozen'. We therefore implement a refrigerator
+    routine, which processes enter and in which they remain until the cycle is
+    complete. Processes enter the refrigerator via try_to_freeze() invocations
+    at appropriate places.  A process cannot be frozen in any old place. It
+    must not be holding locks that will be needed for writing the image or
+    freezing other processes. For this reason, userspace processes generally
+    enter the refrigerator via the signal handling code, and kernel threads at
+    the place in their event loops where they drop locks and yield to other
+    processes or sleep.
+
+    The second part of our method for quisescing the system involves freezing
+    the filesystems. We use the standard freeze_bdev and thaw_bdev functions to
+    ensure that all of the user's data is synced to disk before we begin to
+    write the image. This is particularly important with XFS, where without
+    bdev freezing, activity may still occur after we begin to write the image
+    (potentially causing in-memory and on-disk corruption later).
+
+    Quiescing the system works most quickly and reliably when we add one more
+    element to the algorithm: separating the freezing of userspace processes
+    from the freezing of kernel space processes, and doing the filesystem freeze
+    in between. The filesystem freeze needs to be done while kernel threads such
+    as kjournald can still run.  At the same time, though, everything will be
+    less racy and run more quickly if we stop userspace submitting more I/O work
+    while we're trying to quiesce.
+
+    Quiescing the system is therefore done in three steps:
+	- Freeze userspace
+	- Freeze filesystems
+	- Freeze kernel threads
+
+    If we need to free memory, we thaw kernel threads and filesystems, but not
+    userspace. We can then free caches without worrying about deadlocks due to
+    swap files being on frozen filesystems or such like.
+
+    One limitation of this is that FUSE filesystems are incompatible with
+    suspending to disk. They need to be unmounted prior to suspending, to avoid
+    potential deadlocks.
+
+    b. Ensure enough memory & storage are available.
+
+    We have a number of constraints to meet in order to be able to successfully
+    suspend and resume.
+
+    First, the image will be written in two parts, described below. One of these
+    parts needs to have an atomic copy made, which of course implies a maximum
+    size of one half of the amount of system memory. The other part ('pageset')
+    is not atomically copied, and can therefore be as large or small as desired.
+
+    Second, we have constraints on the amount of storage available. In these
+    calculations, we may also consider any compression that will be done. The
+    cryptoapi module allows the user to configure an expected compression ratio.
+   
+    Third, the user can specify an arbitrary limit on the image size, in
+    megabytes. This limit is treated as a soft limit, so that we don't fail the
+    attempt to suspend if we cannot meet this constraint.
+
+    c. Allocate the required memory and storage space.
+
+    Having done the initial freeze, we determine whether the above constraints
+    are met, and seek to allocate the metadata for the image. If the constraints
+    are not met, or we fail to allocate the required space for the metadata, we
+    seek to free the amount of memory that we calculate is needed and try again.
+    We allow up to four iterations of this loop before aborting the cycle. If we
+    do fail, it should only be because of a bug in Suspend's calculations.
+    
+    These steps are merged together in the prepare_image function, found in
+    prepare_image.c. The functions are merged because of the cyclical nature
+    of the problem of calculating how much memory and storage is needed. Since
+    the data structures containing the information about the image must
+    themselves take memory and use storage, the amount of memory and storage
+    required changes as we prepare the image. Since the changes are not large,
+    only one or two iterations will be required to achieve a solution.
+
+    The recursive nature of the algorithm is miminised by keeping user space
+    frozen while preparing the image, and by the fact that our records of which
+    pages are to be saved and which pageset they are saved in use bitmaps (so
+    that changes in number or fragmentation of the pages to be saved don't
+    feedback via changes in the amount of memory needed for metadata). The
+    recursiveness is thus limited to any extra slab pages allocated to store the
+    extents that record storage used, and he effects of seeking to free memory.
+
+    d. Write the image.
+
+    We previously mentioned the need to create an atomic copy of the data, and
+    the half-of-memory limitation that is implied in this. This limitation is
+    circumvented by dividing the memory to be saved into two parts, called
+    pagesets.
+
+    Pageset2 contains the page cache - the pages on the active and inactive
+    lists. These pages aren't needed or modifed while Suspend2 is running, so
+    they can be safely written without an atomic copy. They are therefore
+    saved first and reloaded last. While saving these pages, Suspend2 carefully
+    ensures that the work of writing the pages doesn't make the image
+    inconsistent.
+
+    Once pageset2 has been saved, we prepare to do the atomic copy of remaining
+    memory. As part of the preparation, we power down drivers, thereby providing
+    them with the opportunity to have their state recorded in the image. The
+    amount of memory allocated by drivers for this is usually negligible, but if
+    DRI is in use, video drivers may require significants amounts. Ideally we
+    would be able to query drivers while preparing the image as to the amount of
+    memory they will need. Unfortunately no such mechanism exists at the time of
+    writing. For this reason, Suspend2 allows the user to set an
+    'extra_pages_allowance', which is used to seek to ensure sufficient memory
+    is available for drivers at this point. Suspend2 also lets the user set this
+    value to 0. In this case, a test driver suspend is done while preparing the
+    image, and the difference (plus a margin) used instead.
+
+    Having suspended the drivers, we save the CPU context before making an
+    atomic copy of pageset1, resuming the drivers and saving the atomic copy.
+    After saving the two pagesets, we just need to save our metadata before
+    powering down.
+
+    As we mentioned earlier, the contents of pageset2 pages aren't needed once
+    they've been saved. We therefore use them as the destination of our atomic
+    copy. In the unlikely event that pageset1 is larger, extra pages are
+    allocated while the image is being prepared. This is normally only a real
+    possibility when the system has just been booted and the page cache is
+    small.
+
+    This is where we need to be careful about syncing, however. Pageset2 will
+    probably contain filesystem meta data. If this is overwritten with pageset1
+    and then a sync occurs, the filesystem will be corrupted - at least until
+    resume time and another sync of the restored data. Since there is a
+    possibility that the user might not resume or (may it never be!) that
+    suspend might oops, we do our utmost to avoid syncing filesystems after
+    copying pageset1.
+
+    e. Power down.
+
+    Powering down uses standard kernel routines. Suspend2 supports powering down
+    using the ACPI S3, S4 and S5 methods or the kernel's non-ACPI power-off.
+    Supporting suspend to ram (S3) as a power off option might sound strange,
+    but it allows the user to quickly get their system up and running again if
+    the battery doesn't run out (we just need to re-read the overwritten pages)
+    and if the battery does run out (or the user removes power), they can still
+    resume.
+
+4.  Data Structures.
+
+    Suspend2 uses three main structures to store its metadata and configuration
+    information:
+
+    a) Pageflags bitmaps.
+
+    Suspend records which pages will be in pageset1, pageset2, the destination
+    of the atomic copy and the source of the atomically restored image using
+    bitmaps. These bitmaps are created from order zero allocations to maximise
+    reliability. The individual pages are combined together with pointers to
+    form per-zone bitmaps, which are in turn combined with another layer of
+    pointers to construct the overall bitmap.
+
+    The pageset1 bitmap is thus easily stored in the image header for use at
+    resume time.
+
+    As mentioned above, using bitmaps also means that the amount of memory and
+    storage required for recording the above information is constant. This
+    greatly simplifies the work of preparing the image. In earlier versions of
+    Suspend2, extents were used to record which pages would be stored. In that
+    case, however, eating memory could result in greater fragmentation of the
+    lists of pages, which in turn required more memory to store the extents and
+    more storage in the image header. These could in turn require further
+    freeing of memory, and another iteration. All of this complexity is removed
+    by having bitmaps.
+
+    Bitmaps also make a lot of sense because Suspend2 only ever iterates
+    through the lists. There is therefore no cost to not being able to find the
+    nth page in order 0 time. We only need to worry about the cost of finding
+    the n+1th page, given the location of the nth page. Bitwise optimisations
+    help here.
+
+    The data structure is: unsigned long ***.
+
+    b) Extents for block data.
+
+    Suspend2 supports writing the image to multiple block devices. In the case
+    of swap, multiple partitions and/or files may be in use, and we happily use
+    them all. This is accomplished as follows:
+
+    Whatever the actual source of the allocated storage, the destination of the
+    image can be viewed in terms of one or more block devices, and on each
+    device, a list of sectors. To simplify matters, we only use contiguous,
+    PAGE_SIZE aligned sectors, like the swap code does.
+
+    Since sector numbers on each bdev may well not start at 0, it makes much
+    more sense to use extents here. Contiguous ranges of pages can thus be
+    represented in the extents by contiguous values.
+
+    Variations in block size are taken account of in transforming this data
+    into the parameters for bio submission.
+
+    We can thus implement a layer of abstraction wherein the core of Suspend2
+    doesn't have to worry about which device we're currently writing to or
+    where in the device we are. It simply requests that the next page in the
+    pageset or header be written, leaving the details to this lower layer.
+    The lower layer remembers where in the sequence of devices and blocks each
+    pageset starts. The header always starts at the beginning of the allocated
+    storage.
+
+    So extents are:
+
+    struct extent {
+      unsigned long minimum, maximum;
+      struct extent *next;
+    }
+
+    These are combined into chains of extents for a device:
+
+    struct extent_chain {
+      int size; /* size of the extent ie sum (max-min+1) */
+      int allocs, frees;
+      char *name;
+      struct extent *first, *last_touched;
+    };
+
+    For each bdev, we need to store a little more info:
+
+    struct suspend_bdev_info {
+       struct block_device *bdev;
+       dev_t dev_t;
+       int bmap_shift;
+       int blocks_per_page;
+    };
+
+    The dev_t is used to identify the device in the stored image. As a result,
+    we expect devices at resume time to have the same major and minor numbers
+    as they had while suspending.  This is primarily a concern where the user
+    utilises LVM for storage, as they will need to dmsetup their partitions in
+    such a way as to maintain this consistency at resume time.
+
+    bmap_shift and blocks_per_page record apply the effects of variations in
+    blocks per page settings for the filesystem and underlying bdev. For most
+    filesystems, these are the same, but for xfs, they can have independant
+    values.
+
+    Combining these two structures together, we have everything we need to
+    record what devices and what blocks on each device are being used to
+    store the image, and to submit i/o using bio_submit.
+
+    The last elements in the picture are a means of recording how the storage
+    is being used.
+
+    We do this first and foremost by implementing a layer of abstraction on
+    top of the devices and extent chains which allows us to view however many
+    devices there might be as one long storage tape, with a single 'head' that
+    tracks a 'current position' on the tape:
+
+    struct extent_iterate_state {
+      struct extent_chain *chains;
+      int num_chains;
+      int current_chain;
+      struct extent *current_extent;
+      unsigned long current_offset;
+    };
+
+    That is, *chains points to an array of size num_chains of extent chains.
+    For the filewriter, this is always a single chain. For the swapwriter, the
+    array is of size MAX_SWAPFILES.
+
+    current_chain, current_extent and current_offset thus point to the current
+    index in the chains array (and into a matching array of struct
+    suspend_bdev_info), the current extent in that chain (to optimise access),
+    and the current value in the offset.
+
+    The image is divided into three parts:
+    - The header
+    - Pageset 1
+    - Pageset 2
+
+    The header always starts at the first device and first block. We know its
+    size before we begin to save the image because we carefully account for
+    everything that will be stored in it.
+
+    The second pageset (LRU) is stored first. It begins on the next page after
+    the end of the header.
+
+    The first pageset is stored second. It's start location is only known once
+    pageset2 has been saved, since pageset2 may be compressed as it is written.
+    This location is thus recorded at the end of saving pageset2. It is page
+    aligned also.
+
+    Since this information is needed at resume time, and the location of extents
+    in memory will differ at resume time, this needs to be stored in a portable
+    way:
+
+    struct extent_iterate_saved_state {
+        int chain_num;
+        int extent_num;
+        unsigned long offset;
+    };
+
+    We can thus implement a layer of abstraction wherein the core of Suspend2
+    doesn't have to worry about which device we're currently writing to or
+    where in the device we are. It simply requests that the next page in the
+    pageset or header be written, leaving the details to this layer, and
+    invokes the routines to remember and restore the position, without having
+    to worry about the details of how the data is arranged on disk or such like.
+
+    c) Modules
+
+    One aim in designing Suspend2 was to make it flexible. We wanted to allow
+    for the implementation of different methods of transforming a page to be
+    written to disk and different methods of getting the pages stored.
+
+    In early versions (the betas and perhaps Suspend1), compression support was
+    inlined in the image writing code, and the data structures and code for
+    managing swap were intertwined with the rest of the code. A number of people
+    had expressed interest in implementing image encryption, and alternative
+    methods of storing the image.
+
+    In order to achieve this, Suspend2 was given a modular design.
+
+    A module is a single file which encapsulates the functionality needed
+    to transform a pageset of data (encryption or compression, for example),
+    or to write the pageset to a device. The former type of module is called
+    a 'page-transformer', the later a 'writer'.
+
+    Modules are linked together in pipeline fashion. There may be zero or more
+    page transformers in a pipeline, and there is always exactly one writer.
+    The pipeline follows this pattern:
+
+		---------------------------------
+		|          Suspend2 Core        |
+		---------------------------------
+				|
+				|
+		---------------------------------
+		|	Page transformer 1	|
+		---------------------------------
+				|
+				|
+		---------------------------------
+		|	Page transformer 2	|
+		---------------------------------
+				|
+				|
+		---------------------------------
+		|            Writer		|
+		---------------------------------
+
+    During the writing of an image, the core code feeds pages one at a time
+    to the first module. This module performs whatever transformations it
+    implements on the incoming data, completely consuming the incoming data and
+    feeding output in a similar manner to the next module. A module may buffer
+    its output.
+
+    During reading, the pipeline works in the reverse direction. The core code
+    calls the first module with the address of a buffer which should be filled.
+    (Note that the buffer size is always PAGE_SIZE at this time). This module
+    will in turn request data from the next module and so on down until the
+    writer is made to read from the stored image.
+
+    Part of definition of the structure of a module thus looks like this:
+
+        int (*rw_init) (int rw, int stream_number);
+        int (*rw_cleanup) (int rw);
+        int (*write_chunk) (struct page *buffer_page);
+        int (*read_chunk) (struct page *buffer_page, int sync);
+
+    It should be noted that the _cleanup routine may be called before the
+    full stream of data has been read or written. While writing the image,
+    the user may (depending upon settings) choose to abort suspending, and
+    if we are in the midst of writing the last portion of the image, a portion
+    of the second pageset may be reread. This may also happen if an error
+    occurs and we seek to abort the process of writing the image.
+
+    The modular design is also useful in a number of other ways. It provides
+    a means where by we can add support for:
+
+    - providing overall initialisation and cleanup routines;
+    - serialising configuration information in the image header;
+    - providing debugging information to the user;
+    - determining memory and image storage requirements;
+    - dis/enabling components at run-time;
+    - configuring the module (see below);
+
+    ...and routines for writers specific to their work:
+    - Parsing a resume2= location;
+    - Determining whether an image exists;
+    - Marking a resume as having been attempted;
+    - Invalidating an image;
+
+    Since some parts of the core - the user interface and storage manager
+    support - have use for some of these functions, they are registered as
+    'miscellaneous' modules as well.
+
+    d) Sysfs data structures.
+
+    This brings us naturally to support for configuring Suspend2. We desired to
+    provide a way to make Suspend2 as flexible and configurable as possible.
+    The user shouldn't have to reboot just because they want to now suspend to
+    a file instead of a partition, for example.
+
+    To accomplish this, Suspend2 implements a very generic means whereby the
+    core and modules can register new sysfs entries. All Suspend2 entries use
+    a single _store and _show routine, both of which are found in sysfs.c in
+    the kernel/power directory. These routines handle the most common operations
+    - getting and setting the values of bits, integers, longs, unsigned longs
+    and strings in one place, and allow overrides for customised get and set
+    options as well as side-effect routines for all reads and writes.
+
+    When combined with some simple macros, a new sysfs entry can then be defined
+    in just a couple of lines:
+
+    { SUSPEND2_ATTR("progress_granularity", SYSFS_RW),
+      SYSFS_INT(&progress_granularity, 1, 2048)
+    },
+
+    This defines a sysfs entry named "progress_granularity" which is rw and
+    allows the user to access an integer stored at &progress_granularity, giving
+    it a value between 1 and 2048 inclusive.
+
+    Sysfs entries are registered under /sys/power/suspend2, and entries for
+    modules are located in a subdirectory named after the module.

+9.  When will XXX be supported?
+10  How does it work?
+11. Who wrote Suspend2?
+
+1. What is it?
+
+   Imagine you're sitting at your computer, working away. For some reason, you
+   need to turn off your computer for a while - perhaps it's time to go home
+   for the day. When you come back to your computer next, you're going to want
+   to carry on where you left off. Now imagine that you could push a button and
+   have your computer store the contents of its memory to disk and power down.
+   Then, when you next start up your computer, it loads that image back into
+   memory and you can carry on from where you were, just as if you'd never
+   turned the computer off. Far less time to start up, no reopening
+   applications and finding what directory you put that file in yesterday.
+   That's what Suspend2 does.
+
+   Suspend2 has a long heritage. It began life as work by Gabor Kuti, who,
+   with some help from Pavel Machek, got an early version going in 1999. The
+   project was then taken over by Florent Chabaud while still in alpha version
+   numbers. Nigel Cunningham came on the scene when Florent was unable to
+   continue, moving the project into betas, then 1.0, 2.0 and so on up to
+   the present 2.2 series. Pavel Machek's swsusp code, which was merged around
+   2.5.17 retains the original name, and was essentially a fork of the beta
+   code until Rafael Wysocki came on the scene in 2005 and began to improve it
+   further.
+
+2. Why would you want it?
+
+   Why wouldn't you want it?
+   
+   Being able to save the state of your system and quickly restore it improves
+   your productivity - you get a useful system in far less time than through
+   the normal boot process.
+   
+3. What do you need to use it?
+
+   a. Kernel Support.
+
+   i) The Suspend2 patch.
+   
+   Suspend2 is part of the Linux Kernel. This version is not part of Linus's
+   2.6 tree at the moment, so you will need to download the kernel source and
+   apply the latest patch. Having done that, enable the appropriate options in
+   make [menu|x]config (under Power Management Options), compile and install your
+   kernel. Suspend2 works with SMP, Highmem, preemption, x86-32, PPC and x86_64.
+
+   Suspend2 patches are available from http://suspend2.net.
+
+   ii) Compression and encryption support.
+
+   Compression and encryption support are implemented via the
+   cryptoapi. You will therefore want to select any Cryptoapi transforms that
+   you want to use on your image from the Cryptoapi menu while configuring
+   your kernel.
+
+   You can also tell Suspend to write it's image to an encrypted and/or
+   compressed filesystem/swap partition. In that case, you don't need to do
+   anything special for Suspend2 when it comes to kernel configuration.
+
+   iii) Configuring other options.
+
+   While you're configuring your kernel, try to configure as much as possible
+   to build as modules. We recommend this because there are a number of drivers
+   that are still in the process of implementing proper power management
+   support. In those cases, the best way to work around their current lack is
+   to build them as modules and remove the modules while suspending. You might
+   also bug the driver authors to get their support up to speed, or even help!
+
+   b. Storage.
+
+   i) Swap.
+
+   Suspend2 can store the suspend image in your swap partition, a swap file or
+   a combination thereof. Whichever combination you choose, you will probably
+   want to create enough swap space to store the largest image you could have,
+   plus the space you'd normally use for swap. A good rule of thumb would be
+   to calculate the amount of swap you'd want without using Suspend2, and then
+   add the amount of memory you have. This swapspace can be arranged in any way
+   you'd like. It can be in one partition or file, or spread over a number. The
+   only requirement is that they be active when you start a suspend cycle.
+   
+   There is one exception to this requirement. Suspend2 has the ability to turn
+   on one swap file or partition at the start of suspending and turn it back off
+   at the end. If you want to ensure you have enough memory to store a image
+   when your memory is fully used, you might want to make one swap partition or
+   file for 'normal' use, and another for Suspend2 to activate & deactivate
+   automatically. (Further details below).
+
+   ii) Normal files.
+
+   Suspend2 includes a 'filewriter'. The filewriter can store your image in a
+   simple file. Since Linux has the idea of everything being a file, this is
+   more powerful than it initially sounds. If, for example, you were to set up
+   a network block device file, you could suspend to a network server. This has
+   been tested and works to a point, but nbd itself isn't stateless enough for
+   our purposes.
+
+   Take extra care when setting up the filewriter. If you just type commands
+   without thinking and then try to suspend, you could cause irreversible
+   corruption on your filesystems! Make sure you have backups.
+
+   Most people will only want to suspend to a local file. To achieve that, do
+   something along the lines of:
+
+   echo "Suspend2" > /suspend-file
+   dd if=/dev/zero bs=1M count=512 >> suspend-file
+
+   This will create a 512MB file called /suspend-file. To get Suspend2 to use
+   it:
+
+   echo /suspend-file > /sys/power/suspend2/filewriter/filewriter_target
+
+   Then
+
+   cat /sys/power/suspend2/resume2
+
+   Put the results of this into your bootloader's configuration (see also step
+   C, below:
+
+   ---EXAMPLE-ONLY-DON'T-COPY-AND-PASTE---
+   # cat /sys/power/suspend2/resume2
+   file:/dev/hda2:0x1e001
+   
+   In this example, we would edit the append= line of our lilo.conf|menu.lst
+   so that it included:
+
+   resume2=file:/dev/hda2:0x1e001
+   ---EXAMPLE-ONLY-DON'T-COPY-AND-PASTE---
+ 
+   For those who are thinking 'Could I make the file sparse?', the answer is
+   'No!'. At the moment, there is no way for Suspend2 to fill in the holes in
+   a sparse file while suspending. In the longer term (post merge!), I'd like
+   to change things so that the file could be dynamically resized as needed.
+   Right now, however, that's not possible and not a priority.
+
+   c. Bootloader configuration.
+   
+   Using Suspend2 also requires that you add an extra parameter to 
+   your lilo.conf or equivalent. Here's an example for a swap partition:
+
+   append="resume2=swap:/dev/hda1"
+
+   This would tell Suspend2 that /dev/hda1 is a swap partition you 
+   have. Suspend2 will use the swap signature of this partition as a
+   pointer to your data when you suspend. This means that (in this example)
+   /dev/hda1 doesn't need to be _the_ swap partition where all of your data
+   is actually stored. It just needs to be a swap partition that has a
+   valid signature.
+
+   You don't need to have a swap partition for this purpose. Suspend2
+   can also use a swap file, but usage is a little more complex. Having made
+   your swap file, turn it on and do 
+
+   cat /sys/power/suspend2/swapwriter/headerlocations
+
+   (this assumes you've already compiled your kernel with Suspend2
+   support and booted it). The results of the cat command will tell you
+   what you need to put in lilo.conf:
+
+   For swap partitions like /dev/hda1, simply use resume2=/dev/hda1.
+   For swapfile `swapfile`, use resume2=swap:/dev/hda2:0x242d.
+
+   If the swapfile changes for any reason (it is moved to a different
+   location, it is deleted and recreated, or the filesystem is
+   defragmented) then you will have to check
+   /sys/power/suspend2/swapwriter/headerlocations for a new resume_block value.
+
+   Once you've compiled and installed the kernel and adjusted your bootloader
+   configuration, you should only need to reboot for the most basic part
+   of Suspend2 to be ready.
+
+   If you only compile in the swapwriter, or only compile in the filewriter,
+   you don't need to add the "swap:" part of the resume2= parameters above.
+   resume2=/dev/hda2:0x242d will work just as well.
+
+   d. The hibernate script.
+
+   Since the driver model in 2.6 kernels is still being developed, you may need
+   to do more, however. Users of Suspend2 usually start the process via a script
+   which prepares for the suspend, tells the kernel to do its stuff and then
+   restore things afterwards. This script might involve:
+
+   - Switching to a text console and back if X doesn't like the video card
+     status on resume.
+   - Un/reloading PCMCIA support since it doesn't play well with suspend.
+  
+   Note that you might not be able to unload some drivers if there are 
+   processes using them. You might have to kill off processes that hold
+   devices open. Hint: if your X server accesses an USB mouse, doing a
+   'chvt' to a text console releases the device and you can unload the
+   module.
+
+   Check out the latest script (available on suspend2.net).
+   
+4. Why not just use the version already in the kernel?
+
+   The version in the vanilla kernel has a number of drawbacks. Among these:
+	- it has a maximum image size of 1/2 total memory.
+	- it doesn't allocate storage until after it has snapshotted memory.
+	  This means that you can't be sure suspending will work until you
+	  see it start to write the image.
+	- it performs all of it's I/O synchronously.
+	- it does not allow you to press escape to cancel a cycle
+	- it does not allow you to automatically swapon a file when
+	  starting a cycle.
+	- it does not allow you to use multiple swap partitions.
+	- it does not allow you to use swapfiles.
+	- it does not allow you to use ordinary files.
+	- it just invalidates an image and continues to boot if you
+	  accidentally boot the wrong kernel after suspending.
+	- it doesn't support any sort of nice display while suspending
+	- it is moving toward requiring that you have an initrd/initramfs
+	  to ever have a hope of resuming (uswsusp). While uswsusp will
+	  address some of the concerns above, it won't address all, and
+	  will be more complicated to get set up.
+
+5. How do you use it?
+
+   A suspend cycle can be started directly by doing:
+
+	echo > /sys/power/suspend2/do_resume
+
+   In practice, though, you'll probably want to use the hibernate script
+   to unload modules, configure the kernel the way you like it and so on.
+   In that case, you'd do (as root):
+
+	hibernate
+
+   See the hibernate script's man page for more details on the options it
+   takes.
+
+   If you're using the text or splash user interface modules, one neat feature
+   of Suspend2 that you might find useful is that you can press Escape at any
+   time during suspending, and the process will be aborted.
+   
+   Due to the way suspend works, this means you'll have your system back and
+   perfectly usable almost instantly. The only exception is when it's at the
+   very end of writing the image. Then it will need to reload a small (
+   usually 4-50MBs, depending upon the image characteristics) portion first.
+
+   If you run into problems with resuming, adding the "noresume2" option to
+   the kernel command line will let you skip the resume step and recover your
+   system.
+
+6. What do all those entries in /sys/power/suspend2 do?
+
+   /sys/power/suspend2 is the directory which contains files you can use to
+   tune and configure Suspend2 to your liking. The exact contents of
+   the directory will depend upon the version of Suspend2 you're
+   running and the options you selected at compile time. In the following
+   descriptions, names in brackets refer to compile time options.
+   (Note that they're all dependant upon you having selected CONFIG_SUSPEND2
+   in the first place!).
+
+   Since the values of these settings can open potential security risks, they
+   are usually accessible only to the root user. You can, however, enable a
+   compile time option which makes all of these files world-accessible. This
+   should only be done if you trust everyone with shell access to this
+   computer!
+ 
+   - checksum/enabled
+
+   Use cryptoapi hashing routines to verify that Pageset2 pages don't change
+   while we're saving the first part of the image, and to get any pages that
+   do change resaved in the atomic copy. This should normally not be needed,
+   but if you're seeing issues, please enable this. If your issues stop you
+   being able to resume, enable this option, suspend and cancel the cycle
+   after the atomic copy is done. If the debugging info shows a non-zero
+   number of pages resaved, please report this to Nigel.
+ 
+   - compression/algorithm
+
+   Set the cryptoapi algorithm used for compressing the image.
+
+   - compression/expected_compression
+
+   These values allow you to set an expected compression ratio, which Software
+   Suspend will use in calculating whether it meets constraints on the image
+   size. If this expected compression ratio is not attained, the suspend will
+   abort, so it is wise to allow some spare. You can see what compression
+   ratio is achieved in the logs after suspending.
+
+   - debug_info:
+  
+   This file returns information about your configuration that may be helpful
+   in diagnosing problems with suspending.
+
+   - do_resume:
+
+   When anything is written to this file suspend will attempt to read and
+   restore an image. If there is no image, it will return almost immediately.
+   If an image exists, the echo > will never return. Instead, the original
+   kernel context will be restored and the original echo > do_suspend will
+   return.
+
+   - do_suspend:
+
+   When anything is written to this file, the kernel side of Suspend2 will
+   begin to attempt to write an image to disk and power down. You'll normally
+   want to run the hibernate script instead, to get modules unloaded first.
+
+   - driver_model_beeping
+
+   Enable beeping when suspending and resuming the drivers. Might help with
+   determining where a problem in resuming occurs.
+
+   - */enabled
+
+   These option can be used to temporarily disable various parts of suspend.
+
+   - encryption/*
+
+   The iv, key, save_key_and_iv, mode and algorithm values allow you to
+   select a cryptoapi encryption algoritm, set the iv and key and whether
+   they are saved in the image header. Saving the iv and key in the image
+   header is of course less secure than having them on some external device,
+   such as a USB key. If you want to use a USB key, you'll need to write
+   some scripting in your initrd/ramfs to retrieve the key & iv from your
+   USB key and put them into the entries again prior to doing the echo to
+   do_resume.
+
+   - extra_pages_allowance
+
+   When Suspend2 does its atomic copy, it calls the driver model suspend
+   and resume methods. If you have DRI enabled with a driver such as fglrx,
+   this can result in the driver allocating a substantial amount of memory
+   for storing its state. Extra_pages_allowance tells suspend2 how much
+   extra memory it should ensure is available for those allocations. If
+   your attempts at suspending end with a message in dmesg indicating that
+   insufficient extra pages were allowed, you need to increase this value.
+
+   - filewriter/target:
+
+   Read this value to get the current setting. Write to it to point Suspend
+   at a new storage location for the filewriter. See above for details of how
+   to set up the filewriter.
+
+   - freezer_test
+
+   This entry can be used to get Suspend2 to just test the freezer without
+   actually doing a suspend cycle. It is useful for diagnosing freezing
+   issues.
+
+   - image_exists:
+
+   Can be used in a script to determine whether a valid image exists at the
+   location currently pointed to by resume2=. Returns up to three lines.
+   The first is whether an image exists (-1 for unsure, otherwise 0 or 1).
+   If an image eixsts, additional lines will return the machine and version.
+   Echoing anything to this entry removes any current image.
+
+   - image_size_limit:
+
+   The maximum size of suspend image written to disk, measured in megabytes
+   (1024*1024).
+
+   - interface_version:
+
+   The value returned by this file can be used by scripts and configuration
+   tools to determine what entries should be looked for. The value is
+   incremented whenever an entry in /sys/power/suspend2 is obsoleted or 
+   added.
+
+   - last_result:
+
+   The result of the last suspend, as defined in
+   include/linux/suspend-debug.h with the values SUSPEND_ABORTED to
+   SUSPEND_KEPT_IMAGE. This is a bitmask.
+
+   - log_everything (CONFIG_PM_DEBUG):
+
+   Setting this option results in all messages printed being logged. Normally,
+   only a subset are logged, so as to not slow the process and not clutter the
+   logs. Useful for debugging. It can be toggled during a cycle by pressing
+   'L'.
+
+   - pause_between_steps (CONFIG_PM_DEBUG):
+
+   This option is used during debugging, to make Suspend2 pause between
+   each step of the process. It is ignored when the nice display is on.
+
+   - powerdown_method:
+
+   Used to select a method by which Suspend2 should powerdown after writing the
+   image. Currently:
+
+   0: Don't use ACPI to power off.
+   3: Attempt to enter Suspend-to-ram.
+   4: Attempt to enter ACPI S4 mode.
+   5: Attempt to power down via ACPI S5 mode.
+
+   Note that these options are highly dependant upon your hardware & software:
+
+   3: When succesful, your machine suspends-to-ram instead of powering off.
+      The advantage of using this mode is that it doesn't matter whether your
+      battery has enough charge to make it through to your next resume. If it
+      lasts, you will simply resume from suspend to ram (and the image on disk
+      will be discarded). If the battery runs out, you will resume from disk
+      instead. The disadvantage is that it takes longer than a normal
+      suspend-to-ram to enter the state, since the suspend-to-disk image needs
+      to be written first.
+   4/5: When successful, your machine will be off and comsume (almost) no power.
+      But it might still react to some external events like opening the lid or
+      trafic on  a network or usb device. For the bios, resume is then the same
+      as warm boot, similar to a situation where you used the command `reboot'
+      to reboot your machine. If your machine has problems on warm boot or if
+      you want to protect your machine with the bios password, this is probably
+      not the right choice. Mode 4 may be necessary on some machines where ACPI
+      wake up methods need to be run to properly reinitialise hardware after a
+      suspend-to-disk cycle.  
+   0: Switch the machine completely off. The only possible wakeup is the power
+      button. For the bios, resume is then the same as a cold boot, in
+      particular you would  have to provide your bios boot password if your
+      machine uses that feature for booting.
+
+   - progressbar_granularity_limit:
+
+   This option can be used to limit the granularity of the progress bar
+   displayed with a bootsplash screen. The value is the maximum number of
+   steps. That is, 10 will make the progress bar jump in 10% increments.
+
+   - reboot:
+
+   This option causes Suspend2 to reboot rather than powering down
+   at the end of saving an image. It can be toggled during a cycle by pressing
+   'R'.
+
+   - resume_commandline:
+
+   This entry can be read after resuming to see the commandline that was used
+   when resuming began. You might use this to set up two bootloader entries
+   that are the same apart from the fact that one includes a extra append=
+   argument "at_work=1". You could then grep resume_commandline in your
+   post-resume scripts and configure networking (for example) differently
+   depending upon whether you're at home or work. resume_commandline can be
+   set to arbitrary text if you wish to remove sensitive contents.
+
+   - swapwriter/swapfilename:
+
+   This entry is used to specify the swapfile or partition that
+   Suspend2 will attempt to swapon/swapoff automatically. Thus, if
+   I normally use /dev/hda1 for swap, and want to use /dev/hda2 for specifically
+   for my suspend image, I would
+  
+   echo /dev/hda2 > /sys/power/suspend2/swapwriter/swapfile
+
+   /dev/hda2 would then be automatically swapon'd and swapoff'd. Note that the
+   swapon and swapoff occur while other processes are frozen (including kswapd)
+   so this swap file will not be used up when attempting to free memory. The
+   parition/file is also given the highest priority, so other swapfiles/partitions
+   will only be used to save the image when this one is filled.
+
+   The value of this file is used by headerlocations along with any currently
+   activated swapfiles/partitions.
+
+   - swapwriter/headerlocations:
+
+   This option tells you the resume2= options to use for swap devices you
+   currently have activated. It is particularly useful when you only want to
+   use a swap file to store your image. See above for further details.
+
+   - toggle_process_nofreeze
+
+   This entry can be used to toggle the NOFREEZE flag on a process, to allow it
+   to run during Suspending. It should be used with extreme caution. There are
+   strict limitations on what a process running during suspend can do. This is
+   really only intended for use by Suspend's helpers (userui in particular).
+
+   - userui_program
+
+   This entry is used to tell Suspend what userspace program to use for
+   providing a user interface while suspending. The program uses a netlink
+   socket to pass messages back and forward to the kernel, allowing all of the
+   functions formerly implemented in the kernel user interface components.
+
+   - user_interface/debug_sections (CONFIG_PM_DEBUG):
+
+   This value, together with the console log level, controls what debugging
+   information is displayed. The console log level determines the level of
+   detail, and this value determines what detail is displayed. This value is
+   a bit vector, and the meaning of the bits can be found in the kernel tree
+   in include/linux/suspend2.h. It can be overridden using the kernel's
+   command line option suspend_dbg.
+
+   - user_interface/default_console_level (CONFIG_PM_DEBUG):
+
+   This determines the value of the console log level at the start of a
+   suspend cycle. If debugging is compiled in, the console log level can be
+   changed during a cycle by pressing the digit keys. Meanings are:
+
+   0: Nice display.
+   1: Nice display plus numerical progress.
+   2: Errors only.
+   3: Low level debugging info.
+   4: Medium level debugging info.
+   5: High level debugging info.
+   6: Verbose debugging info.
+
+   - user_interface/enable_escape:
+
+   Setting this to "1" will enable you abort a suspend by
+   pressing escape, "0" (default) disables this feature. Note that enabling
+   this option means that you cannot initiate a suspend and then walk away
+   from your computer, expecting it to be secure. With feature disabled,
+   you can validly have this expectation once Suspend begins to write the
+   image to disk. (Prior to this point, it is possible that Suspend might
+   about because of failure to freeze all processes or because constraints
+   on its ability to save the image are not met).
+
+   - version:
+  
+   The version of suspend you have compiled into the currently running kernel.
+
+7. How do you get support?
+
+   Glad you asked. Suspend2 is being actively maintained and supported
+   by Nigel (the guy doing most of the kernel coding at the moment), Bernard
+   (who maintains the hibernate script and userspace user interface components)
+   and its users.
+
+   Resources availble include HowTos, FAQs and a Wiki, all available via
+   suspend2.net.  You can find the mailing lists there.
+
+8. I think I've found a bug. What should I do?
+
+   By far and a way, the most common problems people have with suspend2
+   related to drivers not having adequate power management support. In this
+   case, it is not a bug with suspend2, but we can still help you. As we
+   mentioned above, such issues can usually be worked around by building the
+   functionality as modules and unloading them while suspending. Please visit
+   the Wiki for up-to-date lists of known issues and work arounds.
+
+   If this information doesn't help, try running:
+
+   hibernate --bug-report
+
+   ..and sending the output to the users mailing list.
+
+   Good information on how to provide us with useful information from an
+   oops is found in the file REPORTING-BUGS, in the top level directory
+   of the kernel tree. If you get an oops, please especially note the
+   information about running what is printed on the screen through ksymoops.
+   The raw information is useless.
+
+9. When will XXX be supported?
+
+   If there's a feature missing from Suspend2 that you'd like, feel free to
+   ask. We try to be obliging, within reason.
+
+   Patches are welcome. Please send to the list.
+
+10. How does it work?
+
+   Suspend2 does its work in a number of steps.
+
+   a. Freezing system activity.
+
+   The first main stage in suspending is to stop all other activity. This is
+   achieved in stages. Processes are considered in fours groups, which we will
+   describe in reverse order for clarity's sake: Threads with the PF_NOFREEZE
+   flag, kernel threads without this flag, userspace processes with the
+   PF_SYNCTHREAD flag and all other processes. The first set (PF_NOFREEZE) are
+   untouched by the refrigerator code. They are allowed to run during suspending
+   and resuming, and are used to support user interaction, storage access or the
+   like. Other kernel threads (those unneeded while suspending) are frozen last.
+   This leaves us with userspace processes that need to be frozen. When a
+   process enters one of the *_sync system calls, we set a PF_SYNCTHREAD flag on
+   that process for the duration of that call. Processes that have this flag are
+   frozen after processes without it, so that we can seek to ensure that dirty
+   data is synced to disk as quickly as possible in a situation where other
+   processes may be submitting writes at the same time. Freezing the processes
+   that are submitting data stops new I/O from being submitted. Syncthreads can
+   then cleanly finish their work. So the order is:
+
+   - Userspace processes without PF_SYNCTHREAD or PF_NOFREEZE;
+   - Userspace processes with PF_SYNCTHREAD (they won't have NOFREEZE);
+   - Kernel processes without PF_NOFREEZE.
+
+   b. Eating memory.
+
+   For a successful suspend, you need to have enough disk space to store the
+   image and enough memory for the various limitations of Suspend2's
+   algorithm. You can also specify a maximum image size. In order to attain
+   to those constraints, Suspend2 may 'eat' memory. If, after freezing
+   processes, the constraints aren't met, Suspend2 will thaw all the
+   other processes and begin to eat memory until its calculations indicate
+   the constraints are met. It will then freeze processes again and recheck
+   its calculations.
+
+   c. Allocation of storage.
+
+   Next, Suspend2 allocates the storage that will be used to save
+   the image.
+
+   The core of Suspend2 knows nothing about how or where pages are stored. We
+   therefore request the active writer (remember you might have compiled in
+   more than one!) to allocate enough storage for our expect image size. If
+   this request cannot be fulfilled, we eat more memory and try again. If it
+   is fulfiled, we seek to allocate additional storage, just in case our
+   expected compression ratio (if any) isn't achieved. This time, however, we
+   just continue if we can't allocate enough storage.
+
+   If these calls to our writer change the characteristics of the image such
+   that we haven't allocated enough memory, we also loop. (The writer may well
+   need to allocate space for its storage information).
+
+   d. Write the first part of the image.
+
+   Suspend2 stores the image in two sets of pages called 'pagesets'.
+   Pageset 2 contains pages on the active and inactive lists; essentially
+   the page cache. Pageset 1 contains all other pages, including the kernel.
+   We use two pagesets for one important reason: We need to make an atomic copy
+   of the kernel to ensure consistency of the image. Without a second pageset,
+   that would limit us to an image that was at most half the amount of memory
+   available. Using two pagesets allows us to store a full image. Since pageset
+   2 pages won't be needed in saving pageset 1, we first save pageset 2 pages.
+   We can then make our atomic copy of the remaining pages using both pageset 2
+   pages and any other pages that are free. While saving both pagesets, we are
+   careful not to corrupt the image. Among other things, we use lowlevel block
+   I/O routines that don't change the pagecache contents.
+
+   The next step, then, is writing pageset 2.
+
+   e. Suspending drivers and storing processor context.
+
+   Having written pageset2, Suspend2 calls the power management functions to
+   notify drivers of the suspend, and saves the processor state in preparation
+   for the atomic copy of memory we are about to make.
+
+   f. Atomic copy.
+
+   At this stage, everything else but the Suspend2 code is halted. Processes
+   are frozen or idling, drivers are quiesced and have stored (ideally and where
+   necessary) their configuration in memory we are about to atomically copy.
+   In our lowlevel architecture specific code, we have saved the CPU state.
+   We can therefore now do our atomic copy before resuming drivers etc.
+
+   g. Save the atomic copy (pageset 1).
+
+   Suspend can then write the atomic copy of the remaining pages. Since we
+   have copied the pages into other locations, we can continue to use the
+   normal block I/O routines without fear of corruption our image.
+
+   f. Save the suspend header.
+
+   Nearly there! We save our settings and other parameters needed for
+   reloading pageset 1 in a 'suspend header'. We also tell our writer to
+   serialise its data at this stage, so that it can reread the image at resume
+   time. Note that the writer can write this data in any format - in the case
+   of the swapwriter, for example, it splits header pages in 4092 byte blocks,
+   using the last four bytes to link pages of data together. This is completely
+   transparent to the core.
+
+   g. Set the image header.
+
+   Finally, we edit the header at our resume2= location. The signature is
+   changed by the writer to reflect the fact that an image exists, and to point
+   to the start of that data if necessary (swapwriter).
+
+   h. Power down.
+
+   Or reboot if we're debugging and the appropriate option is selected.
+
+   Whew!
+
+   Reloading the image.
+   --------------------
+
+   Reloading the image is essentially the reverse of all the above. We load
+   our copy of pageset 1, being careful to choose locations that aren't going
+   to be overwritten as we copy it back (We start very early in the boot
+   process, so there are no other processes to quiesce here). We then copy
+   pageset 1 back to its original location in memory and restore the process
+   context. We are now running with the original kernel. Next, we reload the
+   pageset 2 pages, free the memory and swap used by Suspend2, restore
+   the pageset header and restart processes. Sounds easy in comparison to
+   suspending, doesn't it!
+
+   There is of course more to Suspend2 than this, but this explanation
+   should be a good start. If there's interest, I'll write further
+   documentation on range pages and the low level I/O.
+
+11. Who wrote Suspend2?
+
+   (Answer based on the writings of Florent Chabaud, credits in files and
+   Nigel's limited knowledge; apologies to anyone missed out!)
+
+   The main developers of Suspend2 have been...
+
+   Gabor Kuti
+   Pavel Machek
+   Florent Chabaud
+   Bernard Blackham
+   Nigel Cunningham
+
+   They have been aided in their efforts by a host of hundreds, if not thousands
+   of testers and people who have submitted bug fixes & suggestions. Of special
+   note are the efforts of Michael Frank, who had his computers repetitively
+   suspend and resume for literally tens of thousands of cycles and developed
+   scripts to stress the system and test Suspend2 far beyond the point
+   most of us (Nigel included!) would consider testing. His efforts have
+   contributed as much to Suspend2 as any of the names above.

+		  noresume commandline options _and_ the resume2= and noresume2 ones (for
+		  compatibility). resume= takes precedence over resume2=. Echoing disk 
+		  to /sys/power/state will start a Suspend2 cycle. If resume= doesn't

+/** \mainpage Suspend2.
+ *
+ * Suspend2 provides support for saving and restoring an image of
+ * system memory to an arbitrary storage device, either on the local computer,
+ * or across some network. The support is entirely OS based, so Suspend2 
+ * works without requiring BIOS, APM or ACPI support. The vast majority of the
+ * code is also architecture independant, so it should be very easy to port
+ * the code to new architectures. Suspend includes support for SMP, 4G HighMem
+ * and preemption. Initramfses and initrds are also supported.
+ *
+ * Suspend2 uses a modular design, in which the method of storing the image is
+ * completely abstracted from the core code, as are transformations on the data
+ * such as compression and/or encryption (multiple 'modules' can be used to
+ * provide arbitrary combinations of functionality). The user interface is also
+ * modular, so that arbitrarily simple or complex interfaces can be used to
+ * provide anything from debugging information through to eye candy.
+ *

+ * Raph <grey.havens@earthling.net><BR>
+ * Support for preserving states of network devices and virtual console
+ * (including X and svgatextmode)
+ *
+ * Kurt Garloff <garloff@suse.de><BR>
+ * Straightened the critical function in order to prevent compilers from
+ * playing tricks with local variables.

+ * Extensive testing and help with improving stability. Nigel was constantly
+ * amazed by the quality and quantity of Michael's help.
+ *
+ * Bernard Blackham <bernard@blackham.com.au><BR>
+ * Web page & Wiki administration, some coding. Another person without whom
+ * Suspend would not be where it is.
+ *
+ * ..and of course the myriads of Suspend2 users who have helped diagnose
+ * and fix bugs, made suggestions on how to improve the code, proofread
+ * documentation, and donated time and money.
+ *
+ * Thanks also to corporate sponsors:
+ *

+ * Suspend and PM related issues on company time.
+ * 
+ * <B>LinuxFund.org.</B> Sponsored Nigel's work on Suspend for four months Oct 2003
+ * to Jan 2004.
+ *
+ * <B>LAC Linux.</B> Donated P4 hardware that enabled development and ongoing
+ * maintenance of SMP and Highmem support.
+ *
+ * <B>OSDL.</B> Provided access to various hardware configurations, make occasional
+ * small donations to the project.
