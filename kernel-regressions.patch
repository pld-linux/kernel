Subject: [PATCH] lib/idr.c: Fix bug introduced by RCU fix

The last patch to lib/idr.c caused a bug if idr_get_new_above() was
called on an empty idr:
Usually, nodes stay on the same layer. New layers are added to the top
of the tree.
The exception is idr_get_new_above() on an empty tree: In this case,
the new root node is first added on layer 0, then moved upwards.
p->layer was not updated.

As usual: You shall never rely on the source code comments, they
will only mislead you.
