- removed bconds: preemptive, suspend2, vserver
  now these features are enabled unconditionally, preempt as built in
  CONFIG_PREEMPT_VOLUNTARY and CONFIG_PREEMPT_BKL
Rationale: These features are non-intrusive and have no noticable impact
	   on kernel performance, thus having them on bconds is unnecessary
	   complicating build process.
